Even the Samurai v Assassin, quiet v loud, gameplay is exactly how Tsushima worked. \n\n\n\nI've played the series since the beginning and this is at best a wait and see for me, because they've continually painted themselves into a corner where they either climb a ladder of changes I did not want in the Origins series, or they \"return to their roots\" and go back to gameplay that was dated by the end of the AC II series. The fundamental gameplay should have evolved to be more grounded and specific IMO, and there should be more immersive sim elements. An Assassin's Creed that takes inspiration from the Hitman games would be superb. Instead we've gotten entry after entry that seems more general and more assembled by committee with each iteration.

My issue is it no longer feels like there’s a linear story and that I’m no longer affecting the region I’m in during the time period. \n\nMaybe I’m out of touch but I’d prefer there be at least some structure and passage of time for each of the main story assassinations. I don’t think the characters should be able to zigzag over the greater Kyoto area taking the targets as they see fit; there needs to be more of a narrative reasoning to the timing of each kill or set of kills. I believe Origins had something similar to this. The Sengoku period is documented pretty well from what I understand, and I think that following that narrative somewhat would be better than just killing the baddies at random.",

You'll have a mission that starts at level 15 but then the 3rd step is suddenly jumped up to level 20. This means you have to stop doing the mission and go grind other things to raise your level. The problem is that when you finally get to level 20 you don't care about the first 2 steps anymore. It feels disjointed and you've forgotten why you're even killing this person to begin with.",

I never payed it much mind, but I could not ignore it in this one.\n\nOlder games had cinematography, acting, emotion. You could see the actors making choices in their beats, they walked around the room. It is much more interesting and engaging to watch. This is the power of motion capture. It is obviously more expensive, and it's not realistic to expect Ubisoft to motion capture every single NPC in Shadows.\n\nHowever, all the RPG games faced this problem already. Usually, generic conversations for NPCs are animated using a library of animations during conversation beats, and facial expressions are done procedurally (a game like the Witcher 3 does this). This is all well and good, but I feel like their quality is a lot worse in this one than in all previous RPG AC games.\n\nI've spent 10 hours with Naoe, and every conversation can be described as two characters standing opposite to each other, with their arms behind them, without ever walking around or the camera changing its angles. If there's any emotion in the dialogue, it's usually accompanied by a lot of teeth and dead eyes. It's so boring and cheap looking, and I don't understand how the world can look so beautiful and the parkour/combat animations so great while the dialogue system's animations feel so rushed.\n\nSorry for ranting. Personally, this is my single biggest issue with the game, which is to say everything else is pretty good.",

The movements and expressions feel kind of rigid and stiff is how I would explain it. It's not the worst out there, but it's noticeable compared to other games that does proper facial animations.\n\nAlso as a side note: not a huge fan of locking the cutscenes and dialogues to 30 fps. Jumping between your actual game's fps to suddenly being 30 fps locked just puts me off at times, but at this point, I just got used to it.\n\nOther than that, I'm loving the game.\n\nEDIT: Downvoted for providing actual critique, you guys are something lmao.",

Renaissance Italy, Revolutionary France, Ancient Egypt, Medieval Baghdad. Shadows being the one exception to this, as there's 1000 games set in Feudal Japan going all the way back to the NES. Hexe is an exciting upcoming game, as I can't think of another game set in Central Europe during the witch hunts.   \n  \nCombine this with the digital tourism aspect of the AC games and how they've created a renewed interest in history, and the potential is limitless.\n\nSo what settings would you really like to see the series tackle? \n\nPersonally, I'd love to walk the streets of Ancient Rome. Others on my wish list are the Aztec Empire, Elizabethan London, medieval India, any of the proposed Robin Hood AC games floating around, 1920s New York, and China during the Japanese Occupation in WW2.

The game would be told out of order due to either a glitch in the Animus or the dna of the subject is damaged in some form. The game would take place before and after the great fire of Chiago. If they really want to push tech they could probably set it as a full on \"dual worlds\" style gameplay where, in the open world, you can hotswap between pre and post inferno to do some cool shit. Like that one level in Titanfall 2 but a whole game. The climax would be the exact midpoint of the game during the fire itself.\n\n3: Assassin's Creed \"Syndicate 2\", it's the 20s & 30s of the mid west. Major cities include Minneapollis-St. Paul, Chicago (again, to tie into the previous idea), and probably like Milwaukee or something. You rob banks, get into car chases, bootleg, etc. Main playable characters would be an outlaw couple. Meet all the famous crime figures of the era like Al Capone, John Dilinger, Bonnie & Clyde, etc. Also probably some folks of the FBI as well. The introduction would be one half of the couple escaping jail with John Dilinger as he teaches you a new \"holdup\" mechanic using his iconic wooden gun he carved and used to escape from prison.\n\nMaybe a DLC where you go kill Hitler. That'd be fun.\n\nAnd then I could make a joke about the \"Ubisoft Chicago Trilogy\" like how AC Valhalla, Syndicate, and Watch_Dogs 3 are the \"Ubisoft British Trilogy\"",

Assassins are supposed to work off stealth, both social and physical. The public isn't supposed to know they exist. If Assassins mowed down a dozen guards with a Tommy gun (or AR-15 in a modern setting), the event will be on the news, the police and other law enforcement agencies will be after them, security cameras will pick it up.

AC4 took us to the Caribbean not in the days of pleasure cruises, but the days when people were regularly getting attacked for their money, as the era of piracy was drawing down to a close—an entire way of life brought to a forceful end. That was one of the main themes of the game.\n\nUnity was all about the French Revolution, lots and lots of violence and political turmoil. \n\nI haven’t played Origins or Odyssey, but I know that Origins coincides with the fall of Egypt as an independent power (if under a Macedonian dynasty’s rule) and the beginning of Roman rule there, that’s a massive shift.\n\nValhalla has the whole Viking thing going on, that’s massive violence and turmoil.\n\nAnd Shadows is set during the very violent and tumultuous closing era of Japanese unification. Again, lots of violence.

        "title": "Honest opinion on AC: Shadows after 15 hours in game",
        "text": "Hi there, just wanted to share with you my honest opinion and thoughts on Assasin's Creed Shadows after playing for around 15 hours on both PC and Playstation 5.\n\nAs for my personal background: I've played the Ezio trilogy in the past, but after that and 3, I've lost interest in the series and just occasionally loaded Unity, Odyssey and Valhalla to take a quick look. This is basically the first time I'm that deep into a newer gen AC game. I've played Ghost of Tsushima last year and due to the similarity in setting and combat system I'll probably compare it here and there. I'm trying to be as fair and honest as possible. Please keep in mind that during my 15 hours I've played with Naoe 99% of the time.\n\n**Combat**  \nThe combat in the game works relatively fine if you strictly leave it to the dodge, parry and single counter-attack part. If you move outside this pattern and try anything fancy, the whole system seems to fall apart and feels utterly clunky and in some cases even broken. I'm shocked that the combat feels this unpolished and that - after doing playtests - this has not been tuned.\n\nHowever, it is a two-sided sword, so don't get me wrong, there are some encounters where everything feels perfectly fine and the flow is great, but the majority of the combat feels very rigid, almost \"on rails\" and lacks the proper impact and weight you would imagine.\n\nThere are also some design choices about the combat that puzzled me and that I don't understand at all:\n\n* Especially the long-range enemies with bows and guns are feeling super unpredictable and I don't have any idea what I can do against their attacks other than running around like a maniac or spamming dodge rolls. The times where I was trying to parry their attack I got ultimately shot.\n* It seems that if you lock the camera to an opponent, you'll basically get into the Ghost of Tsushima situation where other enemies are \"waiting\" on each other to attack you. While this design choice is strange in terms of realism, it makes the fighting and combat aspect more \"fair\" IMO. Camera lock comes with it's own caveats: I really hate that the camera rotates with the character after you parry, since it basically makes you feel really disorientated and makes the whole situation much more stressful as it should be. However, if you do not lock the camera to an enemy, AC Shadows has too many situations where combat seems totally unfair. I had the impression that in this mode, enemies are not \"queuing\" their attacks anymore and the mode is: \"anything goes\" which could lead to really unfair situations (multiple arrow shooters attacking you shortly afterwards, making it impossible to parry). In the end this leads to dodge roll spamming.\n* Lack of animations: I have the impression that I've seen every animation too often within the 15 hours, especially if you stealth kill enemies. There seem to be three to four different animations and it feels too repetetive.\n* Overall I got the feeling that in most cases the \"system\" was at fault and not my ability to parry and that the game made it \"unfair\" to me. As though in Ghost of Tsushima, 95% of the time I got the impression that I just needed to \"get gud\" and it was totally my own mistake.\n\n**Enemy AI**  \nNot great. Really not great. Especially if you're doing Stealth, on normal difficulty it is way too easy. But even on higher difficulties the pathing of NPCs etc. really sucks. Bummer. I also have the impressions that enemy AI seems to be unable to climb to most places when compared to predecessors?\n\n**Parkour**  \nMan, what happened to this one? Overall movement feels fine and really great for a third person game, I like and love the walking and running animations and it feels very good. But if you go parkour and climbing things are going in a completely different direction. Naoe feels entirely \"on rails\", the most frustrating part is on top of roofs where she is constantly attaching herself like a magnet to the upper roof parts. Also I do not know and don't have any feeling for it (even after 15 hours of gameplay) when Naoe is actually vaulting over objects by holding X (or shift) and when not. It is totally unpredictable.\n\n**World and exploration**  \nThe world is beautiful, graphics are really great IMHO, although optimization on PC is a total mess and there are several graphical glitches, annoying bugs and it is a shame that a 4070 Ti Super needs to rely on Frame Generation and DLSS to run this game properly at 1440p and Raytracing enabled at 60fps.\n\nHowever: The world is the real star here and feels with the vegetation much more alive. It looks in parts and the right lighting conditions even more impressive than titles such as Red Dead Redemption 2 IMO (which was my gold standard in terms of open world renderings).\n\nHowever, there are certain elements where I'm thinking: This could have been so much better:\n\n* Exploration: I want to like the idea that you do not have the quest markers already in place and the game makes it kind of \"harder\" and more \"explorative\" but why let the user cheat with L2 button then if you're stuck? And in some cases this has been my last resort because most of the times, enemies and stuff is hidden in such strange places, that it probably would have took me half an hour to get there. This seems to be an overall level/quest design issue mixed with \"we can't decide if we want to go this or the other direction, let's make the worst out of both directions\" thing ...\n* Castles: What's the point of doing castles? Sure, I'm getting new inventory but it feels ... dull? I think the concept of places that have been occupied in Ghost of Tsushima works FAR better and motivated me to \"free\" them from enemies.\n* Lookouts: Why is it so easy to go on a lookout? I had the impression that - in past games - lookouts have been small environmental puzzles where you actually needed to find a way on top. Now I'm just constantly pressing L1 to use the grapple hook and ascend myself upwards ... that's it.\n* Far too many fetch quests or side activities where you need to find certain stuff are ... JUST THAT without any enemy encounters or any stuff that happens randomly making it really boring and bland.#\n\n**Overall**  \nAlthough my opinion seems to be more on the critical side: I REALLY like the game overall and think that it has potential to be THE best iteration of Assassin's Creed if it would be more fleshed out in certain areas. I also want to point out again that these are my personal impressions after a fairly limited amount of time (15 hours) and after playing with just one character (Naoe).\n\nOn the other hand I'm kind of amazed that Ubisoft is still not able to provide more seamless parkour, better enemy AI, a world and exploration that is really fun and engaging ... because they are working on this formula for DECADES. It shouldn't be that hard? Hopefully some areas are still going to receive updates, I would highly appreciate if Ubisoft is going to refine combat and enemy AI.\n\nNow let's get back to the controller, interested in hearing your thoughts and opinions and reactions to mine. Happy playing!",

Valhalla was a pretty big downgrade but I still used it just to know where I was in the world.\nCombined with auto-routing on horse I flew beside Bayek in Origins and it was so much fun. Also their bond worked beautifully. I like animal companions.\n\n\n\n\nIn Shadows I use the map more often now or spam Naoe's vision. Ultimately I prefer birdy view, I get lost so easily.",

In many ways, Shadows still retains elements from the previous RPG’s that relied on your bird’s eye view but now feel less intuitive without that feature. \n\nIdentifying enemy commanders and important treasures in forts and castles is now more tedious without an eagle/raven. Naoe’s eagle vision range is way more limited by comparison and can make exploring especially large castles a slog. \n\nEven in terms of general exploration, the lack of a bird’s eye view can be frustrating. When not using guided mode, the game only provides you hints to an objectives location. The previous games did this too but when you were in the general vicinity, your eagle vision granted a much wider field of view in order to pinpoint the location. \n\nNow, you have to practically be on top of the location for Naoe’s eagle vision to spot the blue orbs/objective markers. I understand this is probably a deliberate choice in order to incentivise the use of scouts and create a risk/reward system due to their limited scarcity but I simply don’t like the change. It feels like creating a problem the previous games didn’t have and then offering a solution.\n\nFor me, the bird’s eye view was necessary to improve the sense of exploration when AC pivoted to huge open worlds. Now, we have a huge open world without that quality of life feature and a new layer of friction has developed because of it.",

Even his ranged options have abilities centered around being in the thick of it. That's not really something that he needs considering it honestly doesn't matter how many enemies see him, he's just going to roll through all of them. If you're trying to scout and plan things out with him, then you're kind of playing the wrong character. Which is really a great thing since it gives people two options that are completely opposite of one another.\n\nOf course having options are nice, and you're totally free to play how you want.

I just started the game yesterday on my base PS5 on performance mode and thought it was looking really solid, thought something was wrong when I got there and the framerate fell off a cliff, only to go back to feeling smooth once I left the area. Just got back to the area while playing this afternoon so I’m glad that should hopefully be fixed with this patch.",

I'm not asking for opinions on the game itself, but more looking for clarification about ubisoft+ and the news about the lack of early release.\n\nWith that in mind: do ubisoft+ subs still get 3 day early access to assassins creed shadows or is that scrapped with the rest of it?",

        "text": "Some AC fans might remember that I made a post last year [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cx5mo8/historical_analysis_of_oda_nobunaga_japans_first/) (if you have not read it yet) about the First Great Unifier of Japan himself - even discussing my hopes and fears on how I would like to see Oda Nobunaga be represented in the game with the AC fandom which there were very wonderful insightful conversations... Finding the right balance between artistic creative liberties and faithfulness to history. Half of them ended becoming true as speculated on. \n\nNeedless to say as someone who had Nobunaga as one of my favorite Japanese historical figures ever to study and learn about. AC Shadows in my opinion did right by him - even despite his limited screen time. He was cunning, ambitious and charismatic, had just the right amount of commanding presence, ruthlessness and compassion - he's a man who is human and flawed like us, but ultimately someone who wishes to do everything necessary to bring back peace and stability to Japan after it was torn apart by decades of civil war and political strife in the Sengoku Jidai. In addition the scenes of his friendship with Yasuke I found to be really touching plus the fact that he continued to have a constant presence in how he changed Yasuke's life for the better and Yasuke outright hunting the people who were responsible for his master's death.... Very close to how Nobunaga was depicted in real history and historical documents we have of him while still giving the unique AC spin on him. \n\nWhich was VERY refreshing to me seeing a depiction of Nobunaga who is flawed, but human rather then a cartoonishly evil villain like some media depictions - AC Shadows might be up there as some of my favorite video game depictions of the man himself other then the Samurai Warriors and Nioh games. \n\nSo all in all I am very happy with how Nobunaga was represented in this game overall as a Japanese history lover, but I am curious - how do other AC fans here feel about Oda Nobunaga's depiction and characterization in Shadows?...",

I knew about some controversy surrounding them; however, I kept myself blissfully ignorant of most of it. I'm glad I did if I'm honest.\n\n\nI have not cleared the game in over 122 hours, and I'm not bored. The game finds new ways to draw me in. A lot of those reasons are things I did not know about Japan. I also like how the game quizzes you on historical facts with those random encounters with the riddle master. I still can't get those right, so that presses me to learn more about Japan.\n\n\nAnyway, I digress. Nobunaga in this game seems like a human being, and not some random shogun or daimyo to use as a prop for political agendas. I can relate to his madness and the brilliance of his tactics. I have no idea if the way he is portrayed here is historically accurate, but I do know that he's movie level believable at least -- and that is all I needed to feel for the guy despite Naoe's motivations.",

Just a few more days...\n\nBut, sir, your post made my day lol. Especially in an endless sea of gameplay/etc. posts on the internet (not bad, just not what I'm looking for). Almost nobody talks about the historical figures/their individual portrayals (except Yasuke, Naoe, and passing mentions of Naoe's parents). I was actually genuinely stoked to see someone had made post of a Google Maps listing of all historical sites and seeing the comments of people comparing their photographs to the in-game locations - keep them coming :). I actually plan on doing major write-ups of the history aspects of AC Shadows since I am too diehard of a Japanese history enthusiast (with Sengoku/early Edo periods being my go-tos) once I finally get through the game.\n\nMy current PC barely managed to play the intro cutscene, and from what little glimpse it showed of the Jesuits (nice!), Nobunaga (commanded an intimidating but humane presence, *very* nice first impression), and Mori Ran (made my day; though I wonder how the JP renders Ran's kanji name, is it the 'legend' one (蘭) or the historically accurate one (乱)?), I was taken by surprise by how nicely handled Luis Frois, Alessandro Valignano, Oda Nobunaga, Mori Ranmaru, and more were in just the short screentime they showed in it. There wasn't enough of Akechi Mitsuhide or others for me to properly judge their portrayals (that or my game's lag buffered right over them). \n\nAs I saw from your other comment about there needing to be more threads to discuss historical figures—I'll be right there on it in the near future haha.\n\nI think I vaguely remember your linked post, and I'm right there with you on hoping they would stick closer to the historical accounts (both in contemporary Japanese and European writings) of him, and consulting other accounts for historical accuracy to the socio-culture, and a lot of other nuances.\n\nAdmittedly, I am still very skittish about how AC Shadows might have potrayaed the two Iga Invasions (the first by Oda Chasenmaru Nobukatsu who went off to do his own thing and pissed his father off with the failure), and the second one by Oda Nobunaga to clean up his son's mess -- how they portrayed that, or if the game said it was all Nobunaga for both. I am also curious for how they portray Hashiba Hideyoshi (later Toyotomi Hideyoshi) in this as media has been very... colorful with his wide array of depictions as well (making him 'oh he was always an evil scheming monkey all along actually also the mastermind' being a revived recent trend in his portrayal too isn't my cup of tea with him). Or how they portray Akechi Mitsuhide's.... complex... everything. Do they go over Hideyoshi vs Katsuie at all? Hideyoshi/Chasenmaru Nobukatsu vs Nobutaka/Katusie at the Summit? Hideyoshi vs Ieyasu (when in reality was actually Hideyoshi vs Oda Chasenmaru Nobukatsu)? Are Oda Nobunaga's family members besides Oichi and his son Nobukatsu around at all? So many side-worries, ha. And that's not even getting into my number one reason for being so interested in getting this game!\n\nThank you OP and the others for the reassuring insights on what we history nerds were worried about. I'm looking forward to more discussions like these, it's a pure joy.",

You’ve experienced the absolute trail of devastation that Nobunaga’s ambitions have left behind him. You feel her desire for revenge.\n\nBut you also want Nobunaga to succeed, because he’s so dynamic and fun to watch. And if you know his historical fate, you want him to somehow escape it despite knowing that he does not and will not. It made me want to read fanfic where Yasuke and Naoe manage to spirit him out of the temple to live and fight another day.",

For example, Yasuke’s origin story could have been glimpsed through his conversations with Nobunaga.\n\nFor the very few conversations that they had, I think there was a bit too much of an anti-religion “agenda”, even though Nobunaga actually hated God and religion himself. However, this game isn’t about Nobunaga so he’s just one of the side characters, or a boss, and we can’t focus too much on him.\n\nI think that Yasuke should have eventually questioned and lost his “loyalty” toward Nobunaga, or anyone else really, which maybe he eventually did, while acknowledging how much Nobunaga had changed and influenced him.\n\nI think one of the main themes of this game should have been exploring that contradiction between having loyalty and having your own personal “creed”. Ultimately, obviously your own “creed” should win over “loyalty” in the end.\n\nBtw his “final last words” are from his favorite Noh play called Atsumori, which the full quote is something like this:\n\n>A man's life of 50 years under the sky is nothing compared to the age of this world. Life is but a fleeting dream, an illusion -- Is there anything that lasts forever?",

But the main cast have all done good and bad things. \n\nUbisoft Quebec has learned how to tell a more complex story since AC Odyssey.

The plan was to play 5 before the release of Shadows too but 4 took longer than expected. I’m excited though as it focuses on Nobunaga and Mitsuhide. Nobunaga might’ve stolen the show in Shadows lol. \n\nKnowing of Mitsuhide from SW, it was very unexpected to see his slimier portrayal in Shadows, but it seems Shadows Mitsuhide is closer to historical Mitsuhide instead of the SW “Nobunaga’s evil deeds are too great to bear, he must be stopped “.\n\nI was introduced to Oichi though SW, her story was interesting, marrying Nagamasa Azai and aligning with him though he warred against her brother Nobunaga, then marrying and dying with Katsuie Shibata, refusing his pleas to seek protecting from Hideyoshi. Do you give any credence to the idea that her being a romance option with Yasuke is disrespectful to her cultural image of loyalty?

He was a standout character amongst the cast of characters in AC Shadows and I couldn't be any happier. \n\nAnd yes the actor who voiced and played him in the game is phenomenal, he perfectly embodied Nobunaga's charisma, eccentricism, ruthlessness and nobility... You could tell Ubi Quebec did their research on him quite well...",

Lamers (read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinch%C5%8D_K%C5%8Dki) on what it contains). It's a military chronicle of Nobunaga's day-to-day life, roughly, covers from his childhood (which is more of a summary until it gets more detailed in his adult years) up until the very day he died.\n\n* \"Japonius Tyrannus: The Japanese Warlord Oda Nobunaga Reconsidered\" by Jeroen P. Lamers (it also touches upon Hideyoshi in some parts, especially after Nobunaga's death). \n\nDownside is that they're both expensive, haha, but very highly regarded by scholars and laypersons.\n\nAnother major downside is the books currently on the English market are largely out-of-date (there's been *a lot* of revised history with a bunch of new research breakthroughs in recent years, so many 'old myths' are sticking around, even on the Japanese side).\n\nFor a more general Japanese history recommendations (which also includes the Sengoku/Azuchi-Momoyama period), I can refer you (and anyone else reading this comment) to the Japanese History's Discord Server's: \n\n* [Compiled Book Resouce List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPcTaXw9i4GiEZ6JNYm8n_29ae02QztIwJnA54CjdqmsVORboxsTldaEB4m-1Igd8Ry6Y9y8KqHm_l/pubhtml)\n\n* [Dissertation, Thesis, & Journal Articles Resource List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT9vwxTjcrQYsi5_owPuylT4gGPn28TzRw1T9uly5mFXQwdn4-sMj_kcgYFDKqrZEmlWT7GxuZNc6fh/pubhtml)\n\nIt is also generally recommended to avoid Netflix's Age of Samurai series, as it's largely inaccurate in many areas and not a good representation of Sengoku/Edo period's historical events. (It's also very dramatized like a drama.) Can read rAskHistorians' [How accurate is the Netflix series Age of Samurai?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lutsro/how_accurate_is_the_netflix_series_age_of_samurai/) post and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseHistory/comments/lwtrc8/criticizing_the_errors_of_netflixs_age_of_samurai/) post pointing out the errors.\n\nAdditionally, since it is very likely to run into this author: Stephen Turnbull. He does not have a positive reputation/reception as a 'historian' in the Japanese scholarly sphere. His books *might* be fine if you just want pop history (especially on shinobi/ninja stuff as 'junk food reading for fun'). Avoid if looking for academic reading with actual insight into historical events.",

Yasuke was then sent back to the Jesuit’s and that is where his real life history ends.\n\nYou’re right that Japanese in this time period were wary of foreigners, but it is notable that Oda Nobunaga was known for being much more accepting of foreigners, and people outside of their “societal roles” in general. It was known that he made trade deals with Jesuits in real life, he made Samurai from peasants, and would seek counsel outside of the noble clans that were usually involved in these types of discussion. In fact, it is theorized in that this is one of the reasons Mitsuhide betrayed him in real life, although it’s not 100% clear what his real motivations were in betraying his lord.\n\nOverall, his relationship with Yasuke, outsiders, and foreigners is pretty spot on from the little we know about him regarding the subject.",

In fact its very well documented in Japanese history that *in fact* Nobunaga was one of the several daimyo lords in Japan who was very fond of foreigners and welcomed them with open arms - he loved learning about their cultures, customs and ways of life other then being highly impressed by their technology and firearms to where he had them mass produced for his Samurai armies. \n\nHence why there is quite a lot of records that document his friendship with foreigners like Yasuke and Luis Frois. \n\nSome warlords were cautious towards foreigners yes, but not to the point of being hateful towards them as seen in Shogun and some even offered foreigners hospitality... So its a 50/50. \n\nCause in the same Shogun series you mentioned - Blackthorne and Toranaga's relationship is loosely inspired by the friendship and bond shared with William Adams and Tokugawa Ieyasu in real history...",

It was all Ieyasu himself that went to such extremes.\n\nAll Nobunaga did was say \"do however you see fit\", but *even* he was shocked and taken back by the incident on the action that Ieyasu went with being like \"damn son, did you really have to go that far?\"...\n\nNobunaga was far from a saint, but he's not a psychopath nowhere near Hitler-like even... Plus its not mutually exclusive to him as many other famous daimyo lords have done arguably way worst then him to the point where the court officials filed a complaint to them, but never done so to Nobunaga...",

        "title": "Rainbow Six Siege - New Character Issue",
        "text": "When Ubisoft announced new characters for Rainbow Six Siege, one in particular caught my eye.\n\n***\"Hāpai Iwini was born in Christchurch, in the Rārata iwi to a firefighter father and military sergeant mother. Following in both her parents’ footsteps, she joined the New Zealand Military (Ngāti Tumatauenga). Notably, Iwini made captain after only three years, and following two attempts, she succeeded in the New Zealand Special Air Service trials. It was due to this achievement that she earned her Moko Kauae. She is a lifelong practitioner of Kaupapa Māori and continues to volunteer as a firefighter when not deployed.\"***\n\nThe date of birth of this character is also 15 March. I'll explain this later. Firstly just to explain the kupu Māori (Māori words) that have been used for context.\n\nIwi = People, as in nation, or often tribe.  \nNgāti Tumatauenga = Ngāti= Descendents of; Tumatauenga = God of War - this is the name taken by the NZ Army  \nMoko kauae = traditional tattoo for women from the bottom lip to the bottom of the chin. Moko is a traditional depiction of genealogy and family.\n\nKaupapa = Topic, subject, theme\n\nSo, you may have guessed that I have whakapapa Māori. Just to clarify further, \"wh\" is most frequently pronounced as \"F\". So, when you read the word whakapapa, you're allowed to snigger. It means genealogy or descent so when I say I have whakapapa Māori, it means I am have Māori descent.\n\nI have debated internally about this. There is a consideration to be given to the opinion that representation is a good thing and if there are some errors, it can be pointed out and corrected but the spirit or intent is good.\n\nI considered this and ultimately rejected it because representation can only be good when it's authentic, well researched and as accurate as possible. The reason for that is that authenticity and accuracy are overt indicators of genuine respect for the source or the group you are choosing to represent.\n\nThat being my opinion, let me frame it against this character.\n\n**Rārata iwi** (Rārawa People/Nation/Tribe) does not exist. It is a fabrication. If the intent is that this iwi is based in Christchurch, then all that achieves is to erase the existence of Ngāi Tūāhuriri, the hapū (clan/tribe) whose boundaries include Christchurch (South Island, NZ). This hapū is part of the wider iwi, Ngāi Tahu - whose boundaries are the greater part of the South Island. This is very important because the Ngāi Tahu iwi were almost extinct by the early years of the 20th century due to the effects of land dispossession, WW1 and the 1918 influenza epidemic. The iwi has regained strength and now is an influential voice in the South Island. I am not of Ngāi Tahu descent but given the history of that iwi, seeing themselves completely excluded because Ubisoft either declined or refused to engage prior to including this character, I would be concerned. If the intent is that this character's iwi is not from Christchurch but moved to Christchurch, the issue remains that it is made up, thereby rendering all existing iwi as unimportant.\n\n**Moko kauae** Tattoos of this type are not \"awarded.\" In older times, when a man or woman had displayed sufficient mana and status within their people, the elders would convene and advise that it was appropriate for a person to get moko on their face. The head is considered tapu or sacred (taboo in modern language originating from Hawai'i into English) and so any type of tattoo there was a very important thing. In modern times, moko kauae is in renaissance with many wahine (women) getting them after consulting with their family. The designs represent whakapapa and family and as such are a visible representation of that. While it is possible that the character's elders or whanau would have agreed that her achievement was worthy of her getting moko kauae, it's not an achievement award. It is more probably that her promotion to Captain would have been the right time to get the moko.\n\n**Kaupapa Māori** This is simply the wrong term. Kaupapa is a term that broadly is defined as \"topic, issue, policy, matter for discussion, purpose.\" The term that is more appropriate is Tikanga, which literally means the right things but is used to describe the practice of Māori cultural norms and traditions. Tikanga is applied to how things are done with food, traditional ceremonies, death and most areas of life. Tikanga encompasses both the physical and spiritual world - similar to practices of halal, kosher or as simple as removing shoes inside a building or how certain meetings are conducted. Protocol is a very accurate way to describe tikanga.\n\nFinally, the date of birth. On **15 March 2019**, a white supremacist terrorist killed 51 Muslims in two mosques in Christchurch. Anyone who was in Christchurch on that day will remember but will want to forget. This is a stark reminder. A character that is armed with semi-automatic weapons fictionally born on that date in Christchurch is at best misguide. If this was intentional then it is inexplicable.\n\nThis gave me a different perspective on the use of the male protagonist in AC: Shadows. The issue I have is not that the character is African but that the character is not Japanese. Samurai is a uniquely Japanese experience yet Japanese were not thought to be the best representation of that.\n\nIf one was to propose that this is fictional and therefore there is creative licence allowed, I would consider that. However, I believe that the use of Māori terms and words is more compelling evidence that the intent was to appear culturally accurate and appropriate.\n\nI have communicated this to Ubisoft directly and given this is one character in one game, in the great scheme of things is for most of you not an issue. I would invite you to consider this from the point of view of those whose culture is being used by a foreign company to sell video games. In fact, doing this can only harm the cause of seeking more diversity and equality because it adds fuel to the anti-Woke/DEI groups.\n\n[https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/rauora](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/rauora)",

I don't know how else to explain without going into even more detail lol.  \n\nWhat I miss is different finishers for different enemies.  I'm pretty sure other games have had it?  \nShould be special and longer for the targets and regular and quick for lesser enemies.  \n\nBrutes should have their own finishers too.  I assume it already activates on the last enemy of a fight.  \n\nBut it gets tedious when it's 2 finishers for every fight, even tho it's just the last enemy (or just one enemy in total).  \n\nI don't remember if some longer moves happen while there are still enemies present.  Kinda odd watching a finisher while enemies just wait and stare.  \nThe skill attacks are different bc you take damage while using them if someone attacks you.  \n\nI've just unlocked Yasuke so I haven't seen all his stuff but played over 40 hours with Naoe.  Pardon my grammar.  \n\nOh and I have some hope they will update the game - they did with Mirage and generally update a lot post launch.",

The kusarigama has good crowd control with the heavy combo string/heavy posture that breaks armor and yanks them into other enemies/terrain for collision damage when you hold heavy for a grab. It also has an ability that traps the leg and trips enemies for a knockdown. The tanto can stun lock with certain moves and do fast leap in/leap away strikes by holding posture and dodging forward or backwards. The katana has am instant counter when you perfect parry which can be used to parry unblockables and interupt flurry attacks. Every weapon also has dynamic quirks for their combos like the kusarigama that has a special timed input that prolongs any combo, the tanto which has a never ending fast combo and the katana that has a dodge attack. \n\nAll this dynamism is really fun and can be deep/technical, leading to many ways to adapt to any situation. The problem however, is enemies are nerfed so hard in that they are slow, over telegraphed, have generous perfect parry windows and are generally not aggressive, so you never feel like you have to use any of these dynamics. You also get OP just by using very few abilities and damage upgrades. Basically, because you can easily get by most combat encounters by simply leveling up and only using the same basic combo over and over with a parry here and there, all these dynamic moves are not important and is probably why people aren't noticing them or playing around with them. The enemies don't push you to because of the issue i mentioned! \n\nIMO, UBI need to add a master combat difficulty that enhances enemy dynamism so that mastering all the different combos and moves is not only required but also rewarded and engaging!!",

Past that point it seems that Naoe's mechanics just fall behind. Not that she can't fight, but if I was going to fight my way through, I'd just Yasuke it.\n\nIs this just me?",

I appreciate that the game doesn’t rely too much on generic fetch quests like “collect 10 flowers, gather 10 wood, and bring them back\" and instead does let us do actual assassin/samurai activities. \n\nHowever, I’m not a fan of how some quests are spread across the entire map, like target missions where the objectives are scattered across multiple regions, including ones you haven’t even unlocked yet. While it’s cool in a way, it can also feel overwhelming, making it hard to focus on any single quest because you’re constantly reminded of an unfinished backlog.\n\nWhat I do love, though, is how naturally you encounter these targets. I was just walking down a street when I overheard NPCs saying something like, “They don’t even let the musician take a break, his hands are bleeding. The Kabukimono are ruthless.” That led me to climb a nearby building, and sure enough, I found them in a backyard, exactly as described. Moments like that make the world feel alive. There’s also a surprising amount of depth to these side targets—if you pay attention to NPC dialogue and piece things together, you’ll sometimes realize you have the option to spare certain targets.\n\nThen there are the more structured quests, like the ally recruitment ones—Yagoro’s quest was great, and even Junjiro’s and others felt fun.",

The kuji-kiri quests, Naoe and Yasuke personal quests, companion quests and most of the assassination wheels can also be considered side quests. Also, the exclamation marks on the map aren't all collectathons. Some of them have actual story quests or just interesting cutscenes. I agree those 'kill x amount' quests are annoying, but I've just been ignoring them.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the structure of Shadows' side content over Origins and Valhalla, though I think Odyssey is better in this regard. Odyssey had so many side quests littered around the world and I wish Shadows had more of that, but Shadows mostly focuses on the chart to get side quests. Still, Shadows has a crazy amount of quests to do when that chart opens up.",

And once they’re  done, you can just go straight to that menu and collect your reward for it. I think I’d rather games do something more like that, that way I don’t spend hours killing dozens of bandits out of necessity, then grab a quest where I have to kill 100 bandits, but those other dozens of bandits don’t count and now I have to go out of my to specifically kill bandits.

Everything is in service to that theme so even killing 100 bandits has context that grounds me in being an assassin for the people. \n\nIn Odyssey and Valhalla, i found that many of the side quests and activities were all over the place and lacked any context. One minute im settling a dispute, next im killing sharks, then im attacking ships, then i help some horny lady get it off, then im investigating a sewer where some person has abdominal pains and finally im doing a rap battle. Don't get me wrong, i understand why this can be appealing, for me, i just lacked context because nothing was tied to the theme of being an assassin. I was either a demi god, adventurer or some kind of politician so none of the side quests and activities felt in service of any theme!\n\nHowever, as much i like the more focussed theme of Shadows that ties us to being an assassin for the people, i really wish they fleshed it out more by having some real world effect and incentive for killing these targets. An example is the kabukimono, who are supposed to be rowdy and causing havok throughout the land. But you never really see them do anything rowdy outside of some unhinged dialogue, they just wander around or stay in their camps waiting to be killed. They were apparently known for killing random people at night to test their new katana, would be cool to actually seem then attacking random civilians. Or even just have them being rowdy in public and npcs reaction to that! \n\n  \nFor this reason, i think the side quests in older games seem more interesting because UBI has you all over doing random stuff, but because it's always varied and you don't know whats gonna happen, it kind of doesn't matter that's its not focussed or meaningful!",

Naoe and Yasuke have no meaningful conflict or even doubts about their beliefs. The way these characters are written makes it feel very pedantic and childish, like the writers were too afraid to have conflict among the \"good guys\" when Yasuke wasn't part of that club up until recently. \n\nWhatever character growth Naoe could have gets man handled in one awkward scene but somehow none of her goals change excent the fact that the person who murdered half her village is now a good guy and we cool? Yasuke has been given no introspection or breadcrumbs about his past as well, just generic, me good samurai do good. Let's not talk about Oda and how he was a flawed man, or be given a choice in the matter.\n\n  \nShadows, in some way, feels the most barren of the 4 RPGs we have had for almost a decade now. We have fewer animations for combat, fewer armor varieties, and only recolors, and even worse quest design with padding done by hiding quest objectives. Go on, turn on guided exploration and see how hollow the game is, it's that or have your time wasted in a game that wants you to do nothing but finish a checklist, but more importantly, stay in the game by wasting your time than actually have fun or meaningful progression.",

The opportunities surrounding them. By the end, we would unlock a mission surrounding the final target. Of course, nothing would stop you from finding that target yourself, but maybe with the opportunity you discovered you will find some sort of weakness. \n\nLike secret entrances, something like the tea ceremony where you can infiltrate the enemy by securing a contract and pretending to be someone else and maybe you'll find ways to kill him without even meeting him by discovering his favorite food and poisoning it. \n\nFor a game about Assassin, they really don't want to take inspiration from Hitman, which perfected the social stealth aspect.",

Even then, it isn't simulating what really happens to low light and shadows cast by the moon. They tweak the black level in the game for a low light night vision, so we can see around us too.\n\n\nYou can get a sense of what I'm saying if you stand near torchlight with a pitch black shadow near at night. Because the light is bright enough, the game auto contrasts to adjust to the light, and then you can see how deep night shadows actually are..\n\n\nEdit: As far as indoor settings during the day, you can technically find pitch shadows, but I suspect it's harder than other games because RTGI bounce usually causes the houses with windows, and castles with free windows to cascade sunlight all over the surfaces. Not to mention the fact that torches are everywhere.\n\n\nThey even made most of the isolated rooms pretty close to a constant source of daylight, so even if there's shoji frames, they just leak refracted light everywhere. Like I said though, there are places indoors, but they are few because of how Ubi structured the interiors.",

        "text": "Shadows is gorgeous but I can't help but be disappointed in the gameplay coming from Ubi Quebec. Odyssey is my favourite AC because it makes some use of the beautiful open worlds that Ubisoft always builds.\n\nYou could tail a randomized leader of a region, ambush them on the way from a city to a fort, build up a wanted level leading to the \"nemesis\" system to kick in, and next time you infiltrate somewhere else trying to kill an Ancient Order target, a randomized high level enemy may show up and screw over your stealth plans. Oh and if you somehow find a guard with high stats, you might want to knock them unconscious so you can recruit them, further changing how you would approach stealth even if you've been infiltrating the same base a dozen of times.\n\nShadows seems like a perfect setting to improve upon the systems except they're not even to eluded to.\n\n1. The faction war system:\n\nThe Sengoku era should've been perfect for this. You have clans vying for supremacy trying to fill the power vacuums. You are a shinobi. Sure, the story puts some important clans in the forefront but let's not pretend 4 full summers passed in just one year 1582 during my main story playthrough is anywhere near realistic. You can have randomized minor houses taking over castles and your assassinations can tip the power for Hideyoshi or Tokugawa or the waning Oda (let's pretend Naoe and Yasuke try to maintain the balance of power to maintain peace). The season system would have blended perfectly with this by creating different conditions to force players to stealth through.\n\n2. The \"nemesis\" system\n\nIt's right there. Iga vs Kouga. Naoe is one of the last surviving Iga shinobis, it's natural that her exploits lead to other clans hiring Kouga shinobis to go after her, and to the extension of trying to hunt down Yasuke too. Kouga Ninja Scrolls is a piece of Japanese fiction about the two ninja clans at war, each given a list of names of all the shinobis on the other side to kill... which is literally translates to what the nemesis system can be. I keep seeing glimpses of it here: the guardians and the occasional random ninja ambush.\n\n3. MGSV \"Recruitment\" System\n\nYou have a hideout and supposedly an alliance of invisible NPCs to scout for you... but nope, this system isn't in the game either. Granted that once recruited in Odyssey, those NPCs are pretty useless, and that in Shadows scouts are pretty useless other than to hold you back from collecting too many resources, this system on a minute by minute level really changes how Naoe players approach stealth if they want to only knock certain targets unconscious. It could force Yasuke players to need to bust out the fists, forcing them to be more careful too.\n\nI always found the Odyssey gameplay loop anti-climatic... once you weaken a faction enough in a region you trigger a big battle event that just ends with some loot. Climbing the nemesis ladder just gets you loot. Recruited NPCs just give you a little stat boost for your ship. This is the part where i wished Shadows improved upon, but it's really disappointing none of these systems are there.",

Some times, you can be restricted from things and still have a lot of agency, and that's not a bad thing. A game that does everything can be good, but it'll never exceed good status because it doesn't have an identity nor direction. Ac Odyssey is an amazing game at being good.",

No, the Steam Deck isn’t a high-end gaming PC, but it’s capable enough to run well-optimized games smoothly.\n\nTake Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, which just launched last week—it’s already 100% playable on the Steam Deck. Now compare that to Rise of the Ronin, which has been out on PS5 for a year. RoR struggles despite being a less visually impressive game. I’m not arguing which game is better, but objectively, AC: Shadows looks significantly better and has more happening on screen, yet it still runs fine on the Deck.\n\nAgain, I get that the Steam Deck isn’t a powerhouse, but if a game runs well on it, that’s usually a good sign that it’s properly optimized.\n\nIts been more than a year and even Dragon's Dogma 2 runs like shit.

        "text": "After playing Shadows for 75 hours and having had a great time, I for natural reasons started to feel the need for a break. Even though I adore the stealth, combat, movement, seasons and weather there are parts of the game that I find lacking.\n\nAs I booted up Odyssey on my PS5 I immediately missed the graphics, movement and combat, but the characters and story in Odyssey is leagues ahead. I actually care about Kassandra, the dialogue is excellent and the choices are more than being merciful and kind or vengeful. I can tell the NPC:s apart in Odyssey and they have so much personality. I think this might be due to stoic Japan though plus westerners typically struggle to tell Asian people apart (especially when every NPC in the game dress the same).\n\nAnd the quests are much more varied. The first 3 hours in Odyssey:\n\n- treasure hunts\n\n- assassination mission\n\n- taking out alpha animals\n\n- ship combat and boarding\n\n- reclaiming stolen property\n\n- Investigations\n\n- bring stalked by a powerful mercenary across an island\n\n- hunting\n\n- searching for a missing brother\n\nAnd I know there will be much more added later on. In Shadows there is almost only assassination missions. Those are my favourite missions for sure, but they lack the originality of the assassination missions in Unity or Mirage. And some variety actually is a good thing.\n\nI haven't finished the last 2 Shinbakfu targets in Shadows, but after testing Odyssey again after so long time, I will wait for the DLC to drop and play Odyssey instead. I played Odyssey on PC back in the day, so bought the season pack for PS5 and am so excited to get on this big adventure.\n\nThat is one thing captured by Origins and Odyssey that I think is lacking in Shadows - the grand sense of a hero's journey and adventure. That what I find in the open world might suprise me.\n\nIn Shadows the open world is breathtaking, but finding the 15th shrine or temple isn't fun. It's \"oh no, I have to wait for Naoe to clap and look for scrolls that for reasons are lying around in the open unaffected by the weather and other people\".\n\nI am impressed with how authentic Japan feels in Shadows. The characters fits the world, they are just so uninteresting and unrelatable.\n\nI hope future updates to Shadows add more open world activities and revamps the shrines and temples. I will never do a meditation or Katana mini game again, that's for sure.\n\nThe perfect AC game for me would be having the systems and movement of Shadows mixed with the story, characters and adventure of Odyssey.",

Yes there is some story there that adds to the world but nothing major. \n\nAnother weak point is definitely the story. I’m a couple hours into Act 3 now and it’s just not hitting.

As for the side content, well that’s a matter of style and taste. I don’t know if it would feel “right” to hunt and kill animals in this one. I do like the objective board too and how some targets can be spared and how your actions can change outcomes a little bit. I would like more variety though. I don’t really miss things like collectathons though. Or random npcs asking me to do waste of time quests that could then be screwed up by them getting attacked accidentally when I try to talk to them again. I think the ronin and shinobi hunting you pales in comparison to the various mercs out for blood in odyssey too. But I’d also give shadows more time to cook as I think it’s already pretty good and if it gets the attention and care and dlc quality that odyssey got, we could be in for a real treat.",

But for me, as someone who’s been a fan since since AC1 released, that shift away from the core identity of the series made *Odyssey* feel like a great open-world RPG, but not a great *AC* game.\n\nThat’s why *Shadows* has been such a refreshing experience. While it may not have as many wildly different quest types, nearly everything in the game (from the main story to the side missions to the objective board) is actually about being an *assassin*. That’s something I’ve missed deeply since the transition to the RPG games. The story and side content all feel grounded in that theme: secrecy, infiltration, and moral ambiguity.\n\nI also think the side content in *Shadows* is more layered than it gets credit for. There’s a difference between the little activities (like Kuji-kiri or shrines), the side quests with cutscenes, and the objective board. You can definitely approach the objective board by selecting a target, finding them, and killing them, but each group in the objective board has its own context and often interlocking stories, and the way you *discover* them, sometimes by overhearing conversations or exploring naturally, makes the world feel alive and interconnected.\n\nOne area where *Shadows* absolutely shines for me is in the level design, especially the castles. Compared to the camps in *Odyssey*, which often felt like copy-paste outposts with patrol patterns, the castles in *Shadows* are beautifully designed puzzles. Naoe’s kit makes them a blast to approach: prone crawling, using her grapple hook, using shuriken to destroy light sources, leveraging the weather and shadows for stealth, and all of her varied assassination techniques all contribute to that proper assassin fantasy. I always leave a castle feeling satisfied by the gameplay, not just whatever reward I got. It scratches that old-school stealth itch while still feeling fresh, and these alone are just as memorable for me as any quest in *Odyssey*.\n\nAnd while *Odyssey’s* NPCs were often colorful and over-the-top (which are certainly enjoyable in their own right), I don’t find *Shadows’* characters uninteresting at all, just more reserved and culturally fitting. I particularly like Naoe and Yasuke a lot, especially since we can get a clear sense of their canon personalities via Canon mode. Their interactions in side missions give them depth in a way that’s more subtle than Kassandra, but no less impactful. That said, I haven't beat *Shadows*' story yet so I don't know how their arcs unfold, but already they are up there with Kassandra for me, who I agree is among the best protagonists in the series.\n\nAll that said, I totally get the desire for more “wow” moments or that open-world unpredictability. *Odyssey* delivered that through sheer content volume and spectacle. But for me, *Shadows* is the better *Assassin’s Creed* game: focused, atmospheric, mechanically rewarding, and thematically consistent in a way I’ve really missed.",

I've completed the main quest and rolled credits and now I'm just riding around wrapping up the various other objective circles and it's really enjoyable.\n\nNothing they do was ever going to click for every person but I really don't want to fault them for trying to shake things up from the previous RPG games. *Especially* considering how often everyone mindlessly repeats the \"Ubislop just pumps out the same exact A.C. game over and over waaaah\" sentiment.",

They did this particular thing better in a previous title so why is it not as good in this one?\"\n\nSometimes like with Odyssey or Shadows, you will play and think, this one is so close to being perfect, that I bet the next one will be THE ONE. But then next AC comes along and DOES fix some of the issues you had with the previous, but then will introduce new irritating factors or things you didn't expect or completely remove features you loved\n\nThis is literally EVERY single AC game. It's because they have like 3 studios (I think), each working on the next 3 AC games (one will release next year, the other the year after, etc) - which tbf I think this has slowed in recent years and got longer due to other projects and increases in development time - And I imagine there is some level of collaboration, but also a lot of oversight between the studios. And the bottom line for Ubisoft is money, the AC franchise is a business first and foremost, not a passion or an art for them\n\nIt's a shame because with all the great ideas they've shown in AC games over the years, if they ever decided to focus on making an amazing game, with the game being number one priority, not the profit, then they could put out something really special.. BUT will probs never happen cos to churn out the AC games as fast as they do they've had to develop and grow their multiple studios, which is probably quite costly to maintain asset wise/staff salaries and such, so in a way they are somewhat locked into this cycle they've created, of making games pretty quickly and monetising the hell out of tons of cosmetics to try and keep the business afloat\n\nDidn't mean to ramble so much but there it is",

I have no idea what the hell just happened there and they ended up having their most tedious open world and overall game design.\n\nI enjoyed Valhalla's game design. As they divided the game through numerous faction quests. Each faction had a different storyline, so it was easier to keep track of things and stay relatively invested. \n\nOdyssey offered the best overall RPG experience, basically functioning like The Witcher 3 that isn't as well written; but much bigger. \n\nAnd Origins had the best atmosphere, protagonist, most captivating and felt really fresh.\n\nBut with Shadows... feels like it's a step backwards in every direction other than it's incredible visuals, soundtrack and cutscenes. \n\nMoving around the map feels tedious, now with the hills&woods (aka invisible walls) surrounding the map. Leveling up is locked behind doing the most mundane activities possible. Yasuke feels obsolete outside of main missions due to his slow movement. We've got considerably less amount of weapon types and powers comparing to the previous games and they're character-locked.\n\nThere are some minor new stealth mechanics but stealth in this game still sucks due to the terrible, TERRIBLE enemy AI. It's just not fun trying to outsmart enemies that are blind, deaf, stupid all at once.\n\nAlso I could forgive many of the previous titles' shortcomings because they offered some refreshing settings. Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, Vikings in Great Britain... But this Japan setting is so overused now. Ghost of Tsushima basically was an AC game with a much better story, characters, combat and atmosphere. Then we had Rise of the Ronin, Nioh 2, Wu Long, Sekiro... I like games set in Japan; but I certainly didn't have the same itch I did for the previous settings.",

                "body": "Shadows is basically Hitman. Similar game structure - \"missions\", \"elusive targets\", contracts. Same focus on minute-to-minute gameplay that does the heavy lifting. Gameplay variety in Shadows does not come from all the fluff like alpha animals - it comes from experimenting with different builds, tools and mechanics. It's the same appeal Dishonored games have. If you're after pure gameplay then you're gonna love Shadows. That said, all I've just said got very little to do with what people are normally expecting from an AC game - stories and characters. People have come to expect an AC game to entertain them, meanwhile Shadows just hands you the tools and expects you to entertain yourself. And it's gonna be boring for some.\n\nOdyssey (and Syndicate) got pretty simple core mechanics. Assassinating someone is a rather trivial affair, mechanically speaking. The depth comes from unique opportunities tied to the narrative side of the target. What those games lack in mechanical depth, they make up in all those other activities, like boarding ships and carriage races.\n\nAncient Greece is also a place everyone who's part of Western civilization heard something about, and a place where gods and monsters walking among mortals feels historically accurate, as that's what we were told through Homer's epics. Feudal Japan, on the other hand, is handicapped. It's a very rural landscape at the time, with nothing but shrines and castles and an occasional small town. The names of those shrines - or of those people we meet - mean nothing to most of us, so it's harder to get attached to them. It's portrayed very well how stoic Japanese are - unfortunately, for us gamers stoic often translates into dull and forgettable. I mean, I get it why Ubisoft did not want to make a game set in Japan for so long, it just doesn't make a very good setting for an AC game, ironically.",

Rendered cutscenes, intriguing story to watch progress, no bouncing around the map with targets from multiple branches to overwhelm you. \n\nOnce Yasuke is playable, all that goes away unfortunately. I think the next rendered cutscene after Yasuke is unlocked is at the very end of the main story...it's just lazy. All the interactions with characters between those points are in engine scenes with the awful animations and dialogue to endure.\n\nSame problems happened in Valhalla. Norway is a great intro area that's absolutely beautiful with a respectable amount of content that doesn't feel bogged down. You get to England and it probably takes a couple arcs to sink in that this is your life for the next 60 hours, boring in engine cutscenes.\n\nOdyssey had a more enjoyable story for longer than the rest, but the side content was too samey for me. Clear camps or forts, do boring fetch quest etc. The only thing I remember about Origins was the story going down the drain once Cleo was introduced, not being able to remember the side content at all shows the quality of it.",

Gotta keep in mind that Odyssey took some time to heat up as well. The third play through was my favourite. So much new dialogue facial expressions and other minor additions really fleshed it out. Shadows is beautiful, but it has its glitches and downsides. I’ve had so much fun with this franchise I have faith it’ll become a great addition. One thing I don’t mind bitching about tho is getting lost in the mountain foliage. Keeps you mostly on the trails through the hills. Kassandra could go anywhere.",

There are so many cinematic side missions that it makes it almost impossible to beeline straight to your objective if you're the adventurous type. I had to pass up a guy on my way to rescue Phoebe for narratives sake lol. In comparison, Shadows feels almost barren. Odyssey was great to me and I spent 100s of hours on it not because the main plot or gameplay was stellar, but because of the sense of adventure. \n\nIt legitimately felt like you were on an ancient Greek Odyssey. The lengthy and varied side missions, mercenary system, and the organic fashion in which you could hunt down the Cult of Cosmos (which, imo, is the most I'd ever felt like an assassin dismantling an nefarious secret organization.) Kicker is, the CoC line wasn't even required to beat the main story!\n\n I really hoped that Shadows would have similar side content such as the Olympics and Pirate Island, but it feels so lifeless in comparison despite improving drastically graphically and gameplay wise. The content and sense of adventure just isn't there for me, and that's disappointing.\n\nI think Odyssey was lightning in a bottle. TW3 was still somewhat fresh on everyone's minds, and it shows with some of Odyssey's approaches to side missions and dialogue.",

But the map is way too big with not much to fill it. I am enjoying some of the exploration/side content. But a lot of it is boring. The contracts are all the same, so I stopped doing them. The forts/castles are a lot, kinda boring. The shrines, temples, meditation, and paths are quick and easy enough. But anyways, like I was saying the game map is way too big and they just pack in too much side content/fetch stuff (like they always do). Should’ve zoned into like Kyoto, Osaka, and Azuchi, imo. The size of the map makes it so they don’t accurately reflect how big they would’ve been. Kyoto, for example, was the capital of Japan at that point (until nobunaga changed it to azuchi) but in the game it doesn’t seem to be that impressive of a city. Just kinda seems small and backwoods that’s starting to grow. I feel like Kyoto should have cobblestone streets, and a bigger infrastructure, should be pretty populated. I also feel like while they did their research on location and history, and culture. It’s still kinda base level. I keep feeling like it would be so much better if they revamped and changed basically everything, experimented, etc with gameplay and what you can do. Like wouldn’t it be so cool if naoe was more like a stereotypical shinobi. Meaning you could use poison’s and the like to kill targets, and using methods we haven’t seen before. And what if they went back a little/took a page from splinter cell and made it so you were given specific targets to kill and you couldn’t kill anyone else, or be caught. You could only kill the target, etc. Revamp the stealth system and make it in depth and impactful? Idk but I think that it would be cool. Also, give me actual onsens and such that I can interact with! But idk, I feel like overall the team didn’t really have someone who was passionate about exploring the history and location of Japan. They just did it because they’re losing fans and people wanted the location for 15 years, so they were like “here, don’t leave, we have Japan!” I could be wrong, also I know Ubisoft has overworked staff and harassment issues so",

I'm not sure if I'll put Shadows in the love or hate category, but I hope it will be the former because AC games are what I enjoy playing. I've tried the KCD series and while the story is based on the 15th century and the graphics are phenomenal, the combat is the worst I've ever encountered and is exceptionally difficult to learn, so I was looking forward to Shadows being released. \n\nAnother thing that drives me nuts in most games is the constant rain. And, the night scenes in Shadows makes combat especially difficult. I'll not base my opinion on the game until I have played it for a while. \n\nHopefully, Ubisoft will give us the choice to play the game with night or day and calm down on the torrential rain.",

                "body": "Assassin's Creed used to be my favorite game series about 15 years ago, but when Odyssey released, it became my most disliked game of all time and borderline killed the series for me. I left this community after this subreddit and other places like it became nothing but glazing of a fundamentally very flawed game. I don't want to make premature judgements until I've played all Shadows has to offer, but it's shaping up to be among my favorites in the series. I thought I could come back years 7 years after Odyssey's release to talk about Shadows and it's a shame to see the new hot posts are still shitting on the new game that just came out and still jerking off the 7 year old game. Well, let's take it point by point I guess.\n\n>the characters and story in Odyssey is leagues ahead\n\nWhat excellent characters are present in the opening three hours of Odyssey? \n\n* There's Layla, who they clearly still have no interest in and don't know what to do with in Odyssey.\n* Kassandra isn't a set character, she is the player. She can go from kind and benevolent in one line to evil and sadistic the next at the discretion of the player. She doesn't have \"a character\" in that my understanding of her character could be different from yours, from 10 other people in this thread. You may like her voice acting more, that's very subjective, but I do think her VA generally does a good job, yes.\n* There's the child at the opening who is a standard 'naive, dream big, \"you'll come back for me, won't you Kassandra' child.\n* There's stereotypical \"everybody benefits\" conman who is trying to manipulate everyone in very broad comedy.\n* There's the Cyclops? Whose character is that he's sensitive about his eye? And gets mad when you put his eye inside a butt in very broad comedy.\n* Barnabas? Who is sea-man who talks about the ocean and his great adventures at sea? \n\nTone is one of Odyssey's biggest problems. The opening makes it abundantly clear that it is a game interested in a very light, wacky, comedic, unserious tone that remains consistent through most of the game. This is a main reason I dislike this game so heavily. Even when we get to what is meant to be a tense, serious first scene with the Cult and Deimos, how am I supposed to take it seriously and engage with it unironically when immediately before that, an old woman asked me to go do a collect-a-thon for her to get an aphrodisiac for her impotent husband, only to solve the quest by boinking her so hard she doesn't need it. You cannot have serious stakes that are impactful in the same breath you're making everything a joke. This game is the \"he's right behind me\" complaint people make fun of in Marvel movies amped up to 11.\n\nI do not claim Shadows has incredible characters, but at least I can take it seriously and engage with the drama it is putting forward. Naoe's tragedy strikes early in the game and at no point surrounding that does she put a glass eye into a goat's ass. The game understands its tone and the consequences of having said tone. I can tell the NPC:s apart in Odyssey and they have so much personality Odyssey is certainly more over-exaggerated and animated than trying to be realistic, grounded, or relatable. The game fundamentally reminds me of a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nYou may prefer that where everything is a joke because you want the light-hearted epic Greek adventure. It's like feel-good pop music for your brain rather than listening to Beethoven. If you prefer that tone to a serious one, that's fine, but it's not automatically leagues \"better\" because everything is overly-expressive and jovial. The Room is one of the most memorable movies ever made because everything is so ridiculous. That said, am I engaging with it on a serious level? No. Generally, I think a lot of the best stories that have been told require subtlety and trusting the audience to feel on their own rather than shoving everything obvious in their face.\n\n**CONT'D IN REPLY COMMENT**",

I'm playing AC Rouge now and it's literally night and day when it comes to interactabily with the open world, story telling/structure, and overall acting. Shadows is missing blackbox missions, hunting, and meaningful collectables. Also, the side missions aren't worth doing, because their rewards and the missions themselves aren't that great and get very repetitive. The side activities in general lose their fun factor for me after 20 or so hours(I turned on auto QTEs around this time) as they are severely lacking in variation. I could probably look past a lot of this if the game didn't take roughly 70 hours to 100%.\n\nEdit: If you're going to down vote at least reply with a proper rebuttal you coward.

And while Yasuke's combat is fun and a neat \"distraction\", he still feels really strangely shoehorned into the story. I feel like him as a companion or side character would have worked, with maybe then giving him his own expansion, but the way it was done here is sloppy story telling.

They send ronins and ninjas after you but otherwise there doesn’t seem to be moments in the story where the opposing faction makes any real attempt to stop the league from growing or decimating them. I’d have loved a main quest arc where maybe you have to prevent the shinbakufu from determining true location of the home base..\n\nOr anything really that signifies the opposing faction isn’t just standing in quick sand going everything is fine as their world burns. \n\nOdyssey did a little better with this. My alexios def felt like the opposing faction was menacing throughout the entire game.\n\nI do agree the side missions do feel like targets but I’m okay with that, I like how there’s scouting involved to find the target. It makes it feel like the league is busy as a league. If everything is story beats it kind of feels like the league is just centralized and only contained to Naoe and tasks story.\n\nIt’s a delicate balancing act. ",

Alexios feels like you're a Greek hero and Kassandra feels like you're a lost mercenary with destiny thrust upon them, both are right and both are believable.\n\nEivor for example feels more like a pawn in everyone else's game, very little agency, going with the flow. Naoe and Yasuke have a bit of that too, Yasuke just goes with it and Naoe is so eager to prove herself and fails by every metric possible and just keeps moving the goal post.\n\nThey aren't stories, they're normal people in over their head, which is definitely a theme and I can respect it but I played a good bit of shadows and just thought to myself \"Why am I playing this when I *know* I'll have more fun playing through Odyssey again?\" Yea the bloodline/legacy dlc with the order of the ancients is *extremely* forgettable, the fate of Atlantis DLCs tho? Stupidly fun, play into the unreliability aspect of a human cant quite comprehend what they're being shown so the simulation is filling in the gaps and that was a really fun explanation to keep on theme! \n\nWhereas valhalla for example those sections felt extremely forced.",

This means that it's possible to have different games in execution whilst still feeling like assassin's creed.

Yes, it totally got bloated, I hear that. But every mystery was worth a look, you never knew what you'd find, and even if it was a bit shit, \"malaka!\" and Kassandra sass was worth it.\n\nShadows just feels like it had so much potential. It is beautiful. The stealth is super fun. But am I excited by exploration? Not even remotely. I basically feel like I have to play by following the game objectives, because otherwise I guess I'm just coming back to this castle in a bit with some allies anyway. Am I excited by another shrine? No. Because it's the same thing I've done at the past 10 shrines. Great. Even the mini games don't have any charm. I was pretty interested in the meditation spots when they explored Naoe's background, but really swiftly that ran out of material, and now I'm just pressing some buttons. Same with Yasuke's ones, they just feel like they're missing joy. There's no spark, no whimsy - it just seems a bit soulless in places.\n\nI'm not saying it's not a good game. I just feel like there's a lot of wasted potential, which makes me feel pretty disappointed overall.",

Moving around the map is much more realsitic. Landscapes feel like they matter when it comes to strategy as well. I have good news about the difficulty: theyll be releasing an update which includes an even higher difficulty. We'll see if that focuses on sponginess or AI intelligence though. I know crouching is a minor mechanic, but considering i havent seen it outside of multiplayer games since the Splinter Cell era, its major to me and many other people haha. Hopefully that means itll become a staple for the franchise moving forward. They went with immersion and realism with this game.

If that were the case, Avengers Endgame would be the greatest film ever made and the Star Wars Sequels would be better than the Original Trilogy. Origins does have a good story, largely because Bayek has a set, compelling, and consistent character. Origins' story is largely similar to Shadows' in scale though. The only story to massively surpass it is Odyssey and I find with Odyssey's jokes and scale, it's hard to get invested in the character drama. I would much rather take Origins/Shadows' \"personal crusade of revenge for the death of a family member\" over giant battles between Athens and Sparta. I want to care about a character and the tone and scale of Odyssey make it hard to get invested in something that small. With a scale that big, the game can't focus on what matters and it's why I'm thankful Shadows is much smaller.\n\n>That what I find in the open world might suprise me.\n\nInterestingly, I find Shadows' method of exploration the most engaging the series has had in a long time. In previous RPG AC games, it was always just mark the next ? as a waypoint and run to it. That still exists, but due to them not being on the map until you sync a Viewpoint, it actually feels like I'm exploring and finding the locations through observation rather than following a map, which gets exhausting when you're dozens of ?s into the game.\n\n>In Shadows the open world is breathtaking, but finding the 15th shrine or temple isn't fun. It's \"oh no, I have to wait for Naoe to clap and look for scrolls that for reasons are lying around in the open unaffected by the weather and other people\".\n\nIs the argument that Shadows shouldn't have collectibles? Because uh...every game in the series has them and Odyssey has more lol. Maybe you're specifically arguing against praying, in which case, I like it being interactive as it feels more immersive to me than anything in Odyssey's world, which feels more like a playground for Kassandra than a living, interactive world.\n\n>I am impressed with how authentic Japan feels in Shadows. The characters fits the world, they are just so uninteresting and unrelatable.\n\nAt this point, we're both kinda repeating ourselves, but yes, I agree there's less memorable exaggerated Saturday morning cartoon characters than Odyssey. I am able to take it seriously and feel like it's a real world with fewer horny grandmas who need aphrodisiacs.\n\n**CONT'D IN REPLY COMMENT**",

Assassins Creed is completely different than those other games/franchises.\n\nIn what way would you say Shadows is completely different than Ghost of Tsushima? Also Rise of the Ronin that came out recently? \n\nWith also a bunch of action adventure games set in Japan with a semi-open world, offering similar combat, weapons and aesthetics. \n\nNow if Ubisoft still wanted to make an AC in Japan, I'd just expect them to bring something new on the table. They most certainly did not, other than filling the map with tedious content that are mandatory. \n\n>Moving around the map is much more realsitic. Landscapes feel like they matter when it comes to strategy as well.\n\nIt's your opinion, of course I respect that if you enjoyed this aspect.\n\nPersonally, I did not. As these are basically invisible walls,  forcing us to follow a certain path to destination rather than allowing exploration. \n\n>I have good news about the difficulty: theyll be releasing an update which includes an even higher difficulty. We'll see if that focuses on sponginess or AI intelligence though\n\nI'm not complaining about the difficulty though. My problem is with the AI. A new difficulty option does not mean Ubisoft is going to rewamp the enemy AI.\n\nThis has been an issue for Ubisoft franchises for a long time now. But at least the recent AC games made combat more entertaining with giving us many weapons and powers. Which are quite limited in Shadows. \n\n>I know crouching is a minor mechanic, but considering i havent seen it outside of multiplayer games since the Splinter Cell era, its major to me and many other people haha. Hopefully that means itll become a staple for the franchise moving forward.\n\nDo you mean crawling? Yeah. I mean tactical action games such as MGS V and Breakpoint also have that; but I am happy with that addition in Shadows as well and hopefully it stays.\n\nYet again, enemy AI means everything for a stealth game. Otherwise it just becomes very repetitive, very fast. You stop worrying, that tension is gone when you figure out how the AI works and how simple it is. \n\n>They went with immersion and realism with this game. Thats why we dont have a drone that can scout for us, and why we can't master every weapon known to man haha.\n\nI am more than fine with immersion and realism. Yes, Shadows definitely is my least favorite RPG AC game. But it doesn't mean I think the game sucks.

                "body": "One last complaint I'll levy now (even though I could go on) is how Assassin's Creed Odyssey, more so than any game I've ever played is terrified of inconveniencing the player. It's a large part of why it feels so artificial to me. Fall damage? Inconvenient, get rid of it. Having to use waypoints to discover points of interest? Inconvenient, get rid of it. Being able to climb any surface, even if there aren't handholds? Inconvenient, get rid of it. The game purposefully is designed to smooth out all the friction possible, which is unrealistic. Inconveniencing a player is not an inherently bad thing (although perhaps you think otherwise) because it can result in greater immersion. Having to stop in RDR2 to groom your horse is inconvenient, but it adds to you feeling the role you're meant to. Shadows returns to not being afraid to inconvenience the player for the sake of immersion. You can't climb every surface, you can choose to take fall damage, you stop at shrines to pray,  you can't do every action as both Yasuke and Naoe, and will have to swap characters. These small moments showcasing Yasuke and Naoe are not perfect being superheroes ground the game and make me care and believe these are real people. It's less fake.\n\nIn conclusion, I really dislike Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It's a game with horribly clashing tones, poorly designed gameplay systems, and a giant world that feels like an artificial checklist. Rather than exploring, everything of note is marked on the map from the start. It's a good \"run around Ancient Greece\" simulator, but that's about it. The environmental and character designers did a great job, but in terms of game mechanics, it is horribly lacking depth and the fact it never inconveniences the player leads to a fake feeling world. I'm happy you like the game, but I really hate it and disagree with basically every point made in the original post.\n\nI hope in 7 years that maybe another AC I like will come out and when I come to the subreddit, people won't be shitting on it in the Hot posts.",

How do you guarantee that a character displays evolution, if my last arc can be your first arc? Hell, ac2 had the whole mini arc per target situation, and it was done linearly, beautifully may i add, especially comparing to Valhalla mirage and shadows.

                "body": "I actually feel the side content in Shadows is a refreshing step forward, especially as someone who values the series’ original identity.\n\nOne of my biggest issues with the RPG-era games was how often the content veered into random, off-theme territory. Don’t get me wrong, some of those quests were memorable, but they feel like they belong in any other fantasy RPG, not a game called “Assassin’s Creed”. In contrast, Shadows feels like a return to form. Between the main story and the side missions, there’s a consistent thematic throughline: the life of an assassin navigating a morally complex world.\n\nI also think it’s important to differentiate the types of side content Shadows offers:\n\n* Activities like Kuji-kiri serve as peaceful, reflective minigames that embrace Japanese culture (meditation, mindfulness, seasonal awareness) and offer the player quiet breathing room. These aren’t meant to be bombastic or deep, but atmospheric and reinforcing the setting.\n* The objective board is definitely the heart of the side content. It’s obviously an evolution of the Cult of Kosmos system from Odyssey, but with more narrative layering. Each group has a bit of context, creating mini-arcs that tie into the larger world and lore, and actually feel like an assassin’s bread and butter: locating, stalking, and eliminating targets across Japan.\n* Side quests, while fewer in number, feel more intentional. They don’t exist just to pad the runtime. When Naoe and Yasuke get involved in these stories, they’re actively confronting injustice, not just helping random NPCs fix their roofs. These moments help define their personalities, worldviews, and even highlight their differing philosophies, which adds real emotional weight.\n\nAnd one of my favorite details? How *naturally* the content emerges. You aren’t exclusively walking to an objective marker; you might overhear a conversation while passing through a town, and that breadcrumb leads to a side mission or new board target. Even these overheard convos don’t add a marker to your map or HUD, you have to figure it out yourself or just stumble upon the content later and you might connect the dots of, “oh, this is what those ladies were talking about!” It makes the world feel interconnected and alive, rather than a checklist of isolated tasks.\n\nSo Shadows may not be packed with as many zany one-off side quests like the horny grandma in Odyssey, and maybe to you that means they are lesser, but what it offers feels more cohesive, grounded, and true to the spirit of the franchise, which I prefer.",

However, I'm thinking I need to go back to the main story now and focus on Yasuke and Naoe's journeys to get the most out of the game...\n\nI was hyped for this game, and the setting, main story and visuals definitely tick all boxes for me, but the wider world feels a little dead and empty. Here's hoping consistent updates and the Claws of Awaji later in the year will add further depth.",

                "body": "The issue Shadows has is that almost all of the side content has a very basic level of interaction and barely any story. There's a very, very small number of real side quests, and the assassination boards all play out pretty much the same. Nobutsuna's students is the only notable exception, since the targets all get their own mini stories, the fights are somewhat unique, and the board has an interesting conclusion.\n\n\nEdit: the yokai board is also pretty good.\n\n\nI'm glad you brought up the river raids, because I personally enjoyed them, but I can understand why some people wouldn't. No matter how you feel about them, it's undeniable that they change up the flow of the game. The combat has a new context, there's unique music, and you're meant to quickly fight your way through the chaos to ransack the place before your crew takes too many losses. On top of that, Valhalla had legendary animal boss fights, unique boss fights, and side quests with actual writing. These things helped to break up the flow of the game and keep things from feeling too monotonous. Shadows doesn't really have anything like that, you'll pretty much always be doing the same kind of stealth or the same kind of combat against the same kinds of enemies all the time.\n\n\nThink about the side content in Shadows. Kuji-kiri and kata are just simple QTEs, horse archery is a very basic and not very engaging mini game, hidden paths and kofun are navigation puzzles, which is nice, but they aren't very mechanically or visually interesting. Temples and shrines are just a matter of looking around for white blips, and castles are just standard enemy forts that have been in almost every assassin's creed game, and the only objectives are to kill generic miniboss enemies and loot the big chest. It's interesting to see the subjects of sumi-e, but there's no way to deliberately seek them out.\n\n\nAs far as the objective board goes, almost all of the content is either \"kill 100 enemies in this area\", \"collect X number of this specific item\", or assassination boards, with only a handful of traditional side quests. I don't need to explain why the first two aren't interesting, so I'll just cover the assassination missions. Nearly every assassination target plays out the same way. Sneak/fight into a hostile area and kill the miniboss. The assassination targets don't even have unique movesets, so the fights aren't interesting either.\n\n\nSide content can make or break an open world game, and the side content in Shadows just isn't very good. Overall, I think that people are overhyping Shadows since it's still shiny and new, but once the honeymoon phase is over I think it'll be remembered as one of the weaker entries in the series.",

The world of Shadows is vibrant, but the narrative still finds itself limited by Ubisoft's go anywhere design.

        "text": "I was with this franchise almost from the start (as PC gamer first two entries came later than console releases) and i was in regarding premise from the start. AC was big part of my life (maybe some of you know me from Ubisoft forums, AC Initiates where i was envoy while it lasted), i still have Blood vial from Black Flag that Ubisoft sent me, i followed everything that franchise had to offer even when it hurt (finishing damn Juno arc in comic books) but ever since Ubisoft switched to RPG genre for AC they lost me. Since Origins games lost almost everything that made them AC games and made me like them. \n\nModern day story that started going away ever since Black Flag was kinda reintroduced back with Origins and went nowhere up until Valhalla and then they made it bit more interesting in Valhalla but that was shortly lived and it was killed in next release. And without modern day these games don't feel connected at all. Even whole Isu background is reduced to minimum. \n\nWhole Assassin's Brotherhood thing that made you feel part of something bigger is basically gone too. RPG era games do have some kind of explanation and you are part of some groups but they don't feel at all like Assassin's Brotherhoods from original games. Most of the things you are doing on your own and for your own reasons. \n\nUsage of historical characters and history as big fight between factions is reduced significantly and many targets you are going after are not even historical figures anymore but made up characters. Whole Assassin's vs. Templars angle is kinda dead, it feel more like main character vs. some shadow organization these days. And now in Shadows you can even stumble upon assassination targets that you don't even know why they should be assassinated because you don't need to start quest to find them in the world.  \n\nAlso focus on characters and your bond with them is non kinda existent anymore because you are introduced to so many characters that you spend minimal amount time with them before they are basically discarded after quest is done. You rarely see big multi quest arcs with characters that brings you closer to them. \n\nAnd on top of that RPG era games became too big, too repetitive and without anything unique in them like we had before (AC 2 gave us flying machine, ACR gave us mission where we play as minstrel, and for better or for worse tower defense mini game...). Social stealth is gone too (that actually contributed to one of the most unique Multiplayer experiences to date, outside of Among Us and prop hunt in CoD there is nothing like AC MP), parkour is reduced to pushing stick forward and holding a button (and with jump button removed often leads to issues where game won't allow you to jump over things that are clearly close enough for you to make a jump)... \n\nYou could literally remove Assassin's Cred from the name for past 4 RPG entries and games wouldn't lose anything. Ubisoft simply removed majority things that made AC game AC for me and what is left is beautiful recreation of historical settings without any connection with each other and without anything unique that we don't see in other games.",

However, the game's ending frustrates me a bit.\n(SPOILER WARNING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PLAYED/COMPLETED ASSASSIN'S CREED: SHADOWS)\nI really hate the whole plotline introduced somewhat out of nowhere about Naoe's mother and her apparent partnership with Hattori Hanzo to find her. The game's story kinda hangs on you wanting answers to questions introduced about Noae and Yasuke's past.\n\nWith Yasuke, I thought he had a great ending. His whole character arc about finding purpose in life culminating in that duel with Caro. I think it worked well and brought things to a satisfying conclusion.\n\nMeanwhile, Naoe just gets about 10 minutes of exposition dumped on her, then an optional boss fight that ultimately doesn't really change how the story ends. I like that she learns to forgive. I think that was a big part of her arc. But Hanzo feels like the wrong character for this type of culmination. Granted, idk who I'd replace him with, but I'm getting off subject.\n\nWhy does the story end with a thread that gets introduced right at the end and then goes unsolved? I find that extremely annoying. It doesn't appear that any of the side content will answer these questions. Nor do I honestly see any sort of direct sequel coming our way. Am I maybe overthinking it all, or do you all share my frustration? I'd love to hear some other thoughts on the matter.",

Like, go check on your family or something. I don't hate that plotpoint but why make her mother such a big plotpoint when her dad was the one to raise her. Kinda sad we never got Hanzo as an usable ally but eh whatever. \n\n\nStill, the fact the Assassins and Templars are so vaguely explored is a crime, it feels like they aim for a resolve in a dlc or even second game. ",

A Japanese protagonist in a Japanese game.  \n\nThe whole point of the Assassin’s Creed games is that you play as someone more in the shadows.  You don’t play as Saladin in Assassin’s Creed 1, you don’t play as a Medici in Assassin’s Creed 2, you don’t play as George Washington in Assassin’s Creed 3, etc..  Yasuke is historical enough that he exists, but there’s little about him so there’s room for the fiction that the Assassin’s Creed series brings.  On top of that, he’s kind of an outsider to the culture like most of us will be, so there’s room for learning at the same time as him which is good for bringing the audience along for the ride.  It’s not virtue signalling, it’s seeing a good opportunity and taking it.  And again, Naoe is RIGHT THERE if you want to play a Japanese protagonist.  I reckon I’ll be doing two playthroughs, one as each character.\n\nThe only thing I’ve found about pre-order levels is here which says they’re “Looking very strong”:https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/05/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-already-looking-very-strong\nI think there may be some controversy over a gate being shown with one leg, which is considered culturally insensitive as the most well-known single legged Tori gate was after a major disaster and it was seen and referring to that (likely by accident).  It’s thought to be why they didn’t make an appearance at a Japanese game conference or something.\n\nUbisoft’s stock prices have been rocky for a while.

While that doesn't have anything to do with Shadows per se, given the FY23 ends in March in France and preorders for Shadows didn't open up until after the previous financial year books were closed. I do think it paints an important picture as far as the historical negative outlook people have had on the recent releases in the games history.\n\nFor context, Origins released in October 2017, Odyssey in October 2018 and Valhalla in November 2020. As the financial year end is in March, all the initial sales will be captured in the sales data for the years 2018, 2019 and 2021.\n\nSyndicate released in October 2015, so that data is in the 2015/16 year.\n\nIf you spend enough time in discussions about Ubisoft, which I'm sure you'll have. You'll no doubt be familiar with the very vocal people that have cried about the games now sucking ever since they transitioned over to their newer open world RPG style format, but the sales data directly contradicts this. People are actually buying more Assassins Creed games then ever before with the new format. I know this has nothing to do with DEI, but it is an important point about how a bunch of morons crying on the internet doesn't always have a basis in reality. You said it yourself, numbers are facts.\n\nAs far as the DEI argument in Assassins Creed Shadows, I literally just wrote a detailed comment about why the introduction of a Black Samurai actually makes more sense in actual story telling and can't simply just be written off as 'woke' if you understand the actual history of the games, the story and the historical context of immigration with the protagonists. Feel free to  disagree if you like, thats compeltely fine, but it might be something worth considering.\n\n[Here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1gazpz1/comment/ltngu25/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nAlso one thing worth considering before we come back to the numbers next year. The preorders for most people were refunded given changes to different editions, the cancellation of the gold edition and the adjustments to the collectors edition, that has to hold some weight, as if those things weren't changed and people weren't bothered, those sales would still exist had it not been for the automated refunds.\n\nThats not an excuse to say that if sales drop it isn't because if DEI, but its something that should be a factor when it comes to early sales revenue analysis.",

The only report of Yasuke’s age is from Ōta’s *Shinchōkōki* (“The Chronicle of Lord Nobunaga”), a biography of Nobunaga, which describes Yasuke in 1581 as being in his mid-20s, suggesting that his birth year was about 1555....    \n  \n...**Yasuke would have traveled with Valignano** from Cochin to Malacca (modern-day [Melaka](https://www.britannica.com/place/Melaka-Malaysia) in Malaysia), and from there to [Macau](https://www.britannica.com/place/Macau-administrative-region-China) (today a special administrative region of [China](https://www.britannica.com/place/China)), **arriving in Japan at the port of Kuchinotsu**, in modern-day [Nagasaki](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nagasaki-prefecture-Japan) prefecture, in May 1579. Valignano spent his first two years in Japan inspecting the Jesuit mission facilities in the region of [Kyūshū](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyushu-island-Japan), establishing new rules and regulations and an economic basis for the continuation of the mission. As his bodyguard in a part of the world that was embroiled in civil war, Yasuke would have been with him for protection during these two years...  \n  \nIn an unpublished but [extant](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extant) document from about this time, Ōta states that **Nobunaga made Yasuke a vassal**, giving him a house, servants, a sword, and a stipend. During this period, the definition of *samurai* was [ambiguous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ambiguous), but historians think that this would contemporaneously have **been seen as the bestowing of warrior or “samurai” rank**.\"",

My reply to his messages below\n\n\nAside from the fact that the incredible majority of people want more a Japanese male protagonist over Yasuke. Because this AC is set in Feudal Japan and the fact that all samurai warriors were only Japanese men. Additionally, dude was just a footnote in greater men's stories like Nobunaga the \"Demon King of the Sixth Heaven\".\n\n\n> There is an East Asian woman as a protagonist and there have been incredibly vocal people complaining about Valhalla and Oddyssey because they were annoyed that Ubisoft couldn't just have a strong female lead without giving players a way to opt out of it in preference for a male one.\n\n\nThen why do we have a male option in Shadows? See you make no sense. Your argument falls apart like crazy.\nThere have been only a minority of vocal people complaining about the fact that Ubisoft couldn't just have a strong female lead with Naoe. And that certainly aren’t the Yasuke's stans either. I wonder why...So, why couldn't Naoe being the only playable character like Ezior, Arno or Bayek?\n\n\n> So doing this is already in response to the last lot of people crying by making it so Naoe can't simply be replaced by a man with a penis as a character. I don't even know why Ubisoft listens to fans anymore\n\n\nHaving Naoe be a gender option would have been easier to program than trying to force in a male character who can't parkour, sneak around, stealth etc. So why are you rumblings and ranting about over there. Moreover you don't know shit about Japanese history, so you should probably stop writing about things you don't know about. Fujibayashi Nagato is a real historical figure and didn't actually have a daughter named Naoe, but he did have a son historically named Yasumasa. \n\n\nAnd guess what? Yasumasa had nothing written on him, just his name and gender. It was like this guy was really an Assassin doing Creed stuff. It was pretty damn perfect to be honest lol. So why create a fictional girl Naoe or should I say change Yasumasa's gender to female?\n\n\nFunny and weird anecdote, that info was also on Assassin Creed Fandom in the father's behind the scenes but was removed from the site after the poor reception of the Shadows trailers lol. I wonder why...\n\n\n> I mean if you want to get technical, Y Tak is a fake samurai and is being replaced by a real one.\n\n\nPlease stop embarrassing yourself. You want to get technical? Yasuke wasn't a samurai warrior. Uesugi Kenshin the \"God of War\" was that legendary powerful samurai. And Tak is \"Assassin Monk\" not a samurai. How did you get that wrong?\n Again Yasuke was not the ‘Samurai Warrior’ that Westerners imagine samurai to be, slaying one enemy after another etc. Yasuke's samurai status was just only \"in name\", he was not a \"legendary samurai\" who went around mowing down enemies on the battlefield that westerners have in mind, nor did he command troops in battle. Nor did he have that imaginary golden armor and helmet, or any decent armor actually. Only the warlords were like all that historically and they were ALL Japanese men. \n\n\nSo yeah zero, zero foreigners samurai warriors. My bad, I was wrong...I meant they were foreigners warriors, only chinese and korean. But I guess you guys and Ubisoft doesn't see Chinese or Korean men as foreigners in Japan hmm?\n\n\n> You literally opened with \"So no East Asian man\"\n\n\nSo being a Japanese samurai automatically makes anyone Jin 2.0/copy for the Yasuke's fans hmm... again I am not thinking that, you guys are. You know, Japanese history is rich with heroic samurai, but you continue to judge them based on their ethnicity, and not by the content of their character and individuality. It's weird how you guys keep gaslighting Asian men representation and perpetuate the common Western harmuful trope of \"Asian men leads erasure\". As if it were normalizes and acceptable to put them aside in fiction set in their cultures. It's really disconcerting.\n\n\n> And no doubt all of them will be central to the plot. Likely following the same movements and motivations that they did in real life.\n\n\nI would argue Alfred= Nobunaga.\nEivor is fictional so = Naoe. And Yasuke? If we are being honest he should only be a mini-boss alongside the Demon King or something. Or a side characters. At best dlc especially since he was only 15 months Nobunaga's retainers.",

                "body": "\n> The thing that works with Yasuke is the story of his life fits in remarkably well with the current plot of AC. This game occurs 50 years after the death of Ezio in Florance. The real life Yasuke arrived in Japan etc. So he's coming from lands where the Creed is strong and has a strong history through the same methods as we already know the Templars are being introduced to the setting. Plus like other protagonists, since he would be learning the art of subterfuge as an adult, we get to experience that growth rather than just inhereting it as we would with someone who grew up in Japan.\n\n\nJusto's childhood 1552-1563 is unknown. He could have been a kikokushijo, which translates to \"repatriate children\". A Japanese samurai that grew up outside of Japan.\n\n\nMoreover your whole argument falls apart. Yasuke is not an Assassin that brought the Creed.  He is a real person who did nothing of noteworthy historically but somehow turned into a legendorri susmurai in golden armor that stand out to much in the AC universe. Also somehow there was nothing written about him in our AC's modern days...Plus the Portuguese, The Jesuits or the Italian missionary Alessandro Valignano and obviously Nobunaga the Demon King are expected to be Templars not Assassins. Moreover, in established AC lore, the Chinese assassins were the people who brought the Creed to Japan. After Shao Jun and Ezio stuffs. Noticed how we also already have an Asian female protagonist in AC. And still no Asian male protagonist. \n\n> The other important plot relevant point about Yasuke, is that there is no historical depiction of what happened to him, leaving the end of that story open. Unlike with someone like Justo Takayama when we know exactly how his story ended, in Early February 1615 in Manilla dying from fever.\n\n\nSo Justo died pretty much like Ezio. Seem to me Justo was one of the perfect real person for the legendary samurai protagonist male. Yasuke in Japan 1579-1582. And got deported out the country with the Jesuits. And it said he died after 1582. You know Yasuke would have been 60 in 1615.\nLook what we know about Justo.\n\n\n> He managed to acquire Takatsuki Castle (in Takatsuki, Osaka) and participated in the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War (1570-1580) under the warlord Oda Nobunaga. He also fought under the daimyō Toyotomi Hideyoshi during his rule's earlier times, participating in the Battle of Yamazaki (1582), Battle of Shizugatake (1583) and Siege of Kagoshima (1587).\n\n\nThat's it. So we know he participated in those battles. In fact, there is not much written about him between 1587 and 1614, we know nothing about him in those time periods. Like he was truly the legendary samurai doing the Creed doings after being done working with, subterfuge and bluffing the Templars. We know AC Shadows start in 1579. Justo's story is open for AC's narrative and being the male protagonist better than Yasuke. Between 1579 and 1582, Justo's life was again empty. But we know he continued to work under Nobunaga as a samurai.\n\n\n> Then instead of you complaining here there would be a new lot of people crying about the bastardisation of Justo's life to fit the western story telling of Assassins Creed.\n\n\nYeah you meant Yasuke instead. We know how  dumb and mental gymnastics it is to try to fit Yasuke's existence into the storytelling of AC set in Sengoku Japan. Especially when we have a better choice of male protagonist in the form of an actual Japanese samurai or the best choice number 1, ever best option \"a fictional samurai\".\n\n\nAdditionally, it is the Japanese who recommended real samurai, not just me. I just learned of that by reading and translating their comments, sites etc. They know their history better. Seem to me the majority of them wanted and desired the AC set in Feudal Japan to have representation for Japanese men and women via the dual protagonists system.\n\n\n> Also someone that has been a warlord for 7 years doesn't fit into the same scope of development that the other Assassins go through in terms of Character Development. Almost all the protagonists start in their infancy of learning to be an assassin. This probably brings us back to Yam, but Yam already has a story thats been written. Unless you retcon the shit out of him, and then guess what some fans will do then.\n\n\nThe assassin who killed Nobunaga and Hideyoshi in established lore. It is weird he isn't the protagonist male then. I'm sure if Ubisoft did a poll and asked fans to decide who they wanted to play as Yasuke or the assassin monk would be the winner. Plus (1562 – 1639) we know he died at 77. So your argument of knowing someone's death to defend Yasuke's choice is stupid.\n\n\n> written into Yam's story anyway. I mean you could force it to work, but the last 3 AC games play over a significantly larger time period than a 2 year window.\n\n\nAs I wrote above, we actually know nothing about Justo's life. Day to day. He had so many empty periods and years. It was just too perfect.\n\n\n> Which again makes him a better choice because then you're only limited to that time period of movements for historical accuracy. His early years and late years can be open to anything.\n\n\nYasuke was a personal attendant of Nobunaga, he wouldn't even see days on the battlefield and wouldn't have samurai armor anyway.\n\n\nMoreover, Yasuke was apparently born in 1555. We know that he was deported out of Japan with the Jesuits after June 1582. I already show you how Justo's life 1579-1614 is extremely open to anything except some few restricted battles. Seriously, who were Ubisoft's historians and consultants for Shadows...\n\n\n> The opposite with Justo being that the second he walks into the screen there is already significant expectations as to who he is, what he has done, what his reputation is, what his personality is like.\n\n\nYou know, Justo isn't as influential as Nobunaga. Justo was just one of the many warriors of the Unifiers. So please tell me what the Japanese have written about his reputation, his personality and what we expect from him to be like? Describe him to me.\n\n\n> The less written documentation, the more creativity can be introduced.\n\n\nSo you agree a fictional Japanese samurai or the hundreds of Sengoku samurai whose names are recorded only were a much better choice than Yasuke.\n\n\n> No doubt mirroring the same influence that the Ragnarsons had in Valhalla.\n\n\nI know Oni no Hanzō would appear. But then people would asked and questioned why aren't we playing as him instead.",

                "body": ">Yasuke is a pure virtue signaling.\n\nYeah but people are acting unusually surprised about it for the first time ever this year because they are completely unfamiliar with the history of Ubisoft.\n\nHere is the current make up of all the historical playable characters this game has had:\n\n* A Syrian Man\n* An Italian Man (who travelled around Turkey and Syria)\n* A Native American Man (Whose father was from England)\n* An English Man (Who travelled around the West Indies)\n* A French African Woman (In New Orleans)\n* A Barbadian Man\n* An Irish Man (Who travelled to the North Atlantic)\n* A French Man\n* English Twins\n* A Chinese Woman\n* An Indian Man\n* A Russian Man\n* An Egyptian Man (Who may have travelled to Italy, at least his wife did)\n* A Greek Woman/Man (Who evidently travelled to Isle of Skye in Scotland)\n* A Norwegian Woman/Man (Who travels to England, America, Ireland, Scotland and France).\n* A Afghani Man (Who at minimum travelled to Norway and England)\n* and now an African Man and Japanese Woman.\n\nThere is no doubt that Ubisoft are the undisputed champions of diversity and representation in their games, I can't think of a single other game series that has this level of inclusion across its antagonists ever. Simultaneously, I also can't think of a game developer who gets more shit based on the races and genders of their protagonists, people never seem happy. But as well as the diverse cast of protagonist backgrounds, we also have a significant amount of travel present, with most characters travelling vast distances.\n\nBut there is a hugely important distinction to why Yaskuke (a black man) is in Japan that literally no one wants to fucking consider, and that, at its core, its an Assassins Creed game. So in order for there to be some kind of consideration for that fact, there must be at least some integration of 'The Hidden Ones/Assassins' (assuming the latter given the time period) into the plot.\n\nThe next question is, we have Japan which is a relatively homogenous and closed society for that time period, the Hidden Ones / Assassins originated in North Africa and have spread across Europe. But the game hasn't touched on much in terms of Asia with the exception of Shao meeting Ezio in 1524, about 50 years before this game is set.\n\nSo how do we use dynamic story telling to broach the topic of the Hidden Ones / Assassins and their introduction to Japan?\n\nWell, you could always have a White Christian go over as part of a mission group and introduce it, but that would have had a significantly worse reception than having a Black Samurai because it would be a white saviour/hero trope. (plus the assassins are largely non religious, so the context wouldn't even make sense)\n\nYou could have Shao's group go to Japan, but thats arguably even more offensive given Japans history with China.\n\nOr, you could have someone of African descent go over, from where the Hidden Ones originated, which is significantly less culturally insensative as the Chinese or White people. Not only that, but because of the real Yasuke, its not just some woke invention pulled out of somebodies asshole, it mirrors a story with basis in reality for the first foreign-born samurai.\n\nFor me, the setting seems appropriate, but only if the story fits the narrative. If Yasuke goes over as part of a group of assassins and meets Naoe the Shinobi, then there is a story there of him introducing the creeds docterine while she introduces him to her culture, this would support him in his development of becoming a samurai while simultaneously growing her development in the Creed.\n\nThis isn't Ghost of Tushima, you can't just have Samurai for the sake of Samurai without completely ignoring the implications of the greater story that underpins the series.\n\nTL;DR - I don't think this is as virtue signalling as people seem to think on face value.",

So he's coming from lands where the Creed is strong and has a strong history through the same methods as we already know the Templars are being introduced to the setting. Plus like other protagonists, since he would be learning the art of subterfuge as an adult, we get to experience that growth rather than just inhereting it as we would with someone who grew up in Japan. Thats why Jin in GoT was really good, because he was already an established and trained samurai, but thats not where we see his development, we see it in the way of the Shinobi. If we come into the plot with a world class Samurai and he runs around being a world class Saumrai the entire game we may aswell play fucking Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe other important plot relevant point about Yasuke, is that there is no historical depiction of what happened to him, leaving the end of that story open. Unlike with someone like Justo Takayama when we know exactly how his tory ended, in Early February 1615 in Manilla dying from fever.\n\n>Like Justo Takayama, japanese warlord that worked under Oda Nobunaga in 1570-1580. And he started working under Hideyoshi in 1582.\n\nThen instead of you complaining here there would be a new lot of people crying about the bastardisation of Justo's life to fit the western story telling of Assassins Creed. Also someone that has been a warlord for 7 years doesn't fit into the same scope of development that the other Assassins go through in terms of Character Development. Almost all the protagonists start in their infancy of learning to be an assassin. This probably brings us back to Yamauchi, but Yamauchi already has a story thats been written. Unless you retcon the shit out of him, and then guess what some fans will do then.\n\n>It seems like Nobunaga assigned him Creed or Templars missions. It just makes sense. More logical and authentic than Yasuke. Let's remember that Yasuke worked under Nobunaga in 1581-1582 only for 15 months.\n\nThe templars will 100% be introduced through the Western Trade routes and white people, not only is this obvious because of the 'Order' hiding under notions of Chrisitanity, but also because thats what was written into Yamauchi's story anyway.\n\nI mean you could force it to work, but the last 3 AC games play over a significantly larger time period than a 2 year window.\n\n>Let's remember that Yasuke worked under Nobunaga in 1581-1582 only for 15 months.\n\nWhich again makes him a better choice because then you're only limited to that time period of movements for historical accuracy. His early years and late years can be open to anything. The opposite with Justo being that the second he walks into the screen there is already significant expectations as to who he is, what he has done, what his reputation is, what his personality is like. The less written documentation, the more creativity can be introduced.\n\n>Again, I'm not even mentioning the real Sengoku samurai, the legendary ones or the mysterious ones like Nobunaga's hundreds of retainers.\n\nNo doubt mirroring the same influence that the Ragnarsons had in Valhalla.",

Then I stumbled upon a huge storm at night with lightning, and just out of curiosity I changed to quality mode to see if it makes such a big difference; and that’s when it hit me how big that difference can be. How the flashes of lightning now illuminates both the character and the whole scenery for a moment.\n\nSo now I play at quality mode. After about 2 nights of playing I think I got used to the 30 fps. At least it’s a nicely locked 30 with a lot of smoothness. It also helps actually that now the hideout is the same frame rate and visual fidelity as the rest of the world, so I don’t get yanked from one type of experience into another constantly.",

It's such a shame that right now, the game isn't very well optimized for PC, but it can still work amazingly, as long as you tweak the settings to be just right.  To be honest, the game is beautiful on most settings, so I've got a ton to work with.  For me, frame rate is the most important thing.  The biggest issue I found was the cutscenes.  I could care less that they are initially locked to 30fps.  That would be fine.  However, even on a 4080 super, the cutscenes stuttered and lagged down to 10-15 at times.  After retweaking the settings, mostly around, ironically, shadows, the cutscenes are much better now.  I'm still figuring out what works best, but I've found a decent balance for the moment.",

It's generally very obvious to tell which is real and which is a ficticious event (for example, there are no world-spanning real-time spying glasses that uses DNA as a catalyst, but the Civil War in America was a real event)\n\n  \nThere are some historical inaccuracies upon scrutinity that historians and history teachers have commented on (much to their chagrin), but overall they mostly agree they like the idea of using the medium of game to teach a younger generation history, with a medium that is far more appealing than just boring textbooks.

But those are few and far between.\n\n>To defend DICE on that, one of the developers said in an interview \"it's not a WW1/WW2 game, it's a Battlefield game set in X\"\n\nThey said a lot of things, but it's more striking how different the War in the Pacific trailer was compared to the reveal trailer, suggesting that they felt they needed to pander to the so-called hateful gamers. \n\n>Immersion might differ from a casual gamer who doesn't study history as a hobby to one who does.\n\nTrue, but big budget AAA games need to appeal to a mass audience to justify their development costs. That original BF5 reveal trailer turned off a lot of people, so when the pacific expansion was released, the trailer was an attempt to get those players back after lagging sales.\n\nThe trailer featured no women, and only white and Japanese soldiers killing each other. It had the same amount of views as the reveal trailer and many comments exclaiming that this was what the reveal trailer should have been. No, they aren't all history buffs and many would have to look up when and where the depicted battle actually took place, but it feels right to their brains and is what they expect to see. \n\nIt sounds kind of stupid when you think about it until you realize Ubisoft does the same thing. Their target audience expects diversity, so they give them diversity even if it's not entirely accurate. In one game, they deliberately depicted women as receiving education even though it was not accurate to that time and place, but their audience expected gender equality so they made that change.\n\nThe problem, in my view, is that it's not sustainable to simply target the progressive left with games. Not yet, anyway. But left-wing ideology is more important to Ubisoft than moving to the sensible center and increasing their sales.",

The disjointed ‘second-act stories’ were far fewer in number, more fleshed out, and had a unique beginning, middle, end\n\n2. The characters were wayyyyy more interesting, had unique boss battles, personalities, etc, and we spent more time with them. I still remember fighting faith seed in far cry 5 years ago. Gun to my head I doubt i could name more than 3 shinbakufu members. \n\nIn terms of dialogue and personality, Naoe and Yasuke were pretty good, but their motivations always felt super shallow because none of the characters they interact with inspire much of anything. \n\nI never questioned why Far Cry 3’s Jason, a character with little personality, wanted to kill Vaas, because Vaas inspired those emotions by being Vaas. I never questioned why Edward Kenway fought for Blackbeard or Mary Read, because they were characters that were too charismatic not to care about. \n\nConversely, it’s hard to be stirred by Naoe’s hatred for the Shinbakufu because they’re all faceless and then they’re dead, with only the most obvious of plot tropes and meh writing filling the space between those two phases.\n\nI consider myself to have very low standards for video game stories but like, damn.. \n\nAlso, the sequel/DLC bait is absolutely shameless, it’s almost insulting.

And at first the support representative is telling him it’s not a big deal, but the guy goes on to describe what he’s seeing and it sounds like he’s describing an early version of animus stuff. The representative eventually transfers his call to her superior. The superior tells the guy on the line they’ll have a technician come out to look at it. While the phone call is still going you hear knocking on the door and the guys kid saying someone is at the door and trying to get in the house. Then the call ends. The implication being Abstergo sent a Templar to this random guys house that had nothing to do with anything to kill him and his family just because he was, by no fault of his own, getting templar secrets shown to him through his cable. \n\n[it was fucking weird and the kinda shit I wish this series didn’t move away from](https://youtu.be/MAoz7HHUvok?si=H2XUASibIdoPFL7M)",

All the past and future games will eventually be interconnected and available in one place.\n\nAs far as finishing previous arcs before starting this new one, I'm pretty sure they already did that (with the exception of the Unity/Syndicate stuff; I'll give you that one). Desmond's arc ended, even if it could've been wrapped much better. Layla had a trilogy arc from Origins to Valhalla, despite many flaws with her story.\n\nUnless I'm understanding things wrong, Basim's story is a part of this new arc (or at least it's implied to be). So I don't have a problem with that. Especially since they said he's not *currently* in the game. Which could mean either DLC or something in the future.\n\nOne of the main things I'm curious about with the Animus Hub is the fact that they're supposed to be \"tying up loose ends\" in the modern narrative, while paving the way for future story. They already said that they wanted to address any unfinished story arcs and plot threads. So if anything, I'm curious to see how it all pans out. \n\nHaving a central Hub for all the games, wrapping up old plot threads, and continuing the modern narrative with new story. If anything, it's promising in concept. So what this really comes down to is execution. Which we'll obviously have to wait and see. But considering the devs acknowledged they screwed up and have expressed willingness to improve, that's what really matters to me.

They admitted in a press release a few months ago that the modern day story had gotten to a point where it felt like a meaningless “side quest” that was just tacked on to a historical narrative. Going forward, they said they were wanting to change this, by having meaningful modern gameplay that feels “just as important” as the historical stories. Introducing themes and concepts that are also relevant in today’s society.\n\nWhich are definitely pretty words on their part, but execution is obviously key. They openly admitted they messed up, and were going to use the Animus Hub to hopefully tie up loose ends in the overarching story. The hub is supposed to expand over time with lots of modern day content, acting as the thread connecting all the games together. Whether it actually lives up to what they said is debatable, but at least they’re trying.

I don't want to use mouse and keyboard there. Problem is, I can't adopt to stick aiming anymore. Younger players may be used to it, for me it feels clumsy. There are games with heavy aim assist but this feels more like just pulling the trigger and not aiming.\n\nBut for people like me on PS5 there is a perfect solution: gyro aiming (aka motion aiming). There are more and more games that offer this option, even Ubisoft games like SW Outlaws or Avatar.\n\nIt gives you mouse like precision with a controller and feels like you do the aiming and not the aim assist.\n\nAnd no, you don't have to swing your arms around like a Wii remote. Modern gyro aimng is done with tiny movements of your wrists while your controller rests stable in your lap. So you move the same muscles as with a mouse. Bigger camera movements are stille done with the right stick, mouse-like precison comes from the gyro sensor:\n\n[https://x.com/HilariousCow/status/1832620271745860088](https://x.com/HilariousCow/status/1832620271745860088)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GyroGaming/comments/198wq0y/new\\_to\\_gyro\\_gaming\\_start\\_here\\_gyro\\_beginners\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GyroGaming/comments/198wq0y/new_to_gyro_gaming_start_here_gyro_beginners_guide/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/svbqnd/updated\\_playstation\\_list\\_of\\_games\\_with\\_gyro\\_aim/?tl=de](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/svbqnd/updated_playstation_list_of_games_with_gyro_aim/?tl=de) \n\nIf you prefer stick aiming, that's absolutely ok.

Ubisoft Quebec made both Odyssey and Shadows so we are very likely to get a Kassandra crossover into Shadows. If Valhalla had Kassandra we will get her in Shadows for sure. (I hope)\n\nNow we just need more QoL patches and some great DLCs.\n\nOne of the big standout with Shadows has to be the Ubisoft Anvil engine updates and leaving last-gen consoles behind really helps with that.\n\nFuck all the grifter clowns and other similar \"media influencer\" and all their dumbass minions that made Shadows their favorite target (until they get bored and move on to the next target).",

        "text": "I honestly think multiplayer in Nightreign could end up being one of the most game-changing additions we’ve seen in a FromSoftware title to date.\n\nFrom the little we’ve seen and what’s been hinted at in leaks and datamines, it looks like Nightreign is going to be more than just a new map and tougher bosses. There are serious whispers about a more integrated multiplayer system—possibly even something that reshapes how we approach exploration, lore, and world interaction. And as a longtime lore nerd, that idea seriously excites me.\n\nWhat really gets my imagination going is how multiplayer could be used as a tool for discovery, not just combat. Imagine venturing into some deep, shadow-infested tomb with a friend, only to realize the boss’s behavior or dialogue changes depending on who’s in your party. Or stumbling upon NPCs that react differently when you’re in co-op. FromSoft has always loved hiding deep lore behind obscure mechanics, and if multiplayer starts becoming a lens through which we see more of the world—more of the truth—I’m all for it.\n\nAnd then there’s the idea of the Nightreign itself—a place shrouded in darkness, a parallel of sorts to the Lands Between, maybe a reflection or a curse. What if multiplayer was actually canonically justified here? Like, narratively, you’re not just summoning a phantom—you’re tearing through the veil between realms. That could explain why we’re finally able to stick together longer, explore more freely, and maybe even make choices that affect each other’s worlds in subtle ways.\n\nPvP could also be reimagined. If the factions or covenants return, I’d love to see them tied directly to the narrative of Nightreign—like cults or fallen orders trying to assert dominance in this cursed realm. Not just “team blue vs team red,” but ideologies clashing in the shadows.\n\nUltimately, I just think multiplayer in Nightreign is more than a feature—it could be a storytelling device. A way to peel back the layers of this mysterious world, not just through combat or item descriptions, but through shared experiences. And that’s something I think we’ve all wanted more of since Elden Ring dropped.\n\nAnyway, I’m super curious to hear your thoughts on this. Am I reaching? What would your ideal multiplayer system in Nightreign look like? And if you watch the video, let me know what stuck out to you the most.",

So I was disturbed by this news and before watching any videos I checked my stocks.\n\nIn the week prior to launch of Shadows Ubi's stock rose significantly in anticipation. Ending just under $3 a share. Then when sales were not great, the stocks returned to exactly where they were. Shadows neither helped nor hurt stock price.\n\nI went and watched the videos and none of them gave numbers. They just showed the one day of the stocks dropping and said this is proof Ubisoft is going bankrupt and the sky is falling. I realized how disingenuous these videos and creators are. They farm views on hat€ and half truths.\n\nI'm not saying Ubisoft is doing great, they clearly aren't, but the sky isn't falling yet either. I'm tired of not being able to get accurate news.",

The AI in this game grab allies when they can’t find you and their search party expands until the search is over. It’s no different than sitting in a bush for 5 minutes so that’s not an issue by any means. Irl if someone is on your roof and they lay down on the other side, how do you know if they’re still on the roof, or if they jumped down, maybe they ran, you don’t know, you can’t see that person just like in game so that’s not really a complaint. And it makes sense no one can climb. They’re all in heavy armor and never climbed anything before and naoe is running around in a robe and trained to climb and use grapple hooks. Again, if someone was on your roof would YOU climb your roof to get them? Or go “oh fuck, I don’t know how to climb up there, I physically can’t climb up there, let me watch this person until I get help”, which is literally what the AI do.

        "text": "Resting. Being able to rest is something this game NEEDS, I get having to wait but it feels like a mobile game where there's a stamina bar that deplete when you play and you have to wait 10 mins for it to come back, and that just sucks the fun out of the game.\n\nDyes. Like the older games.\n\nHairstyles, Beards. Being able to toggle yasuke's beard on and off would be a nice thing to have. It would also be nice to have other hairstyles for both protags in a shop.\n\nClassic Assassin Outfits (White And Red.) It sucks that there is only one classic assassin outfit that is just a reskin of another outfit even if it's nice.\n\nMore Weapons in Base Game, there's not that much variety in weapon selection and it would suck to have new weapons be in a DLC.\n\nMore finishers. There's not that much variety in finisher animations.\n\nMultiple Headgear. Pretty simple concept, Masks and Hats.\n\nHeadgear in cutscenes. Pretty simple concept, this would be a nice touch.\n\nHood Down, Hood Up. Similar to AC Valhalla but cosmetic impact only. There is not social stealth so it would be nice to have an option for this.\n\nLegacy Outfits. Naoe : Altair, Shao Jun, Connor..?? All Esio Outfits... nah, all of them please. Now- I know this would take a while but I think this game would last a long while if we have access to most AC Outfits. but still those are the ones I would like. Yasuke : Adwale, Connor.\n\nFOV Slider. (Console.) An FOV Slider would be really nice.\n\nNG+. This game needs it.\n\nHidden Blade Customization. This is very unlikely but I think that this would be an awesome feature. I would like to be able to change how my Hidden Blade looks like colors or different models like a simple silver hidden blade. It would also be really cool to be able to switch Hidden Blade Animations to something more simple like Basim's Animations.\n\nI really want shadows to be the best AC when it comes to player choice and customization other than well- Unity.",

And then he only gets one heterosexual love interest and it's a married woman who is also a real life historical figure.\n\nThese clowns have zero respect for black people nor Japanese people. Every single time these white far left losers put black men in anything, they always have to find ways to make him fit safely in their white, western, modern ideology. They always have to make him feel safe and progressive and tamed/neutered to their own world views. They won't consult a black person. They wouldn't even bother to consult a black historian who might have some insight on what Yasuke's life, mannerisms, ideology, and personality might have really been like before he was given to Nobunaga. What his thought on Japan might have been like. What his thought on his situation would have been. Nothing.\n\nNo. Instead they consulted with some white idiot who made up bullshit about him for his book where he cites himself and his own bullshit. and this coward went into hiding after getting called out. Then they consulted moronic woman who likes to write positively about sexual relationships between adult men and underaged boys in Japanese history. This is who these French developers consulted for this game set in Japan.\n\nAnd yes I'm mad. I'm black. I've always loved Japanese culture and Samurai. So of course I knew about Yasuke for *years* before all you normies found out about him and instantly started using him for a ton of fictional bullshit just to pander and virtue signal. This man was not a Samurai. He would have been made a retainer at best. He most likely died and his body burned to the skeleton when Nobunaga was killed. Yeah, it's fun to imagine that he escaped and lived a long peaceful life, but if he did, there would have been a ton of accounts of him being around, but there isn't a single ONE. \n\nThis is the bullshit people with a braincell hate. Yes. I know, 100% a bunch of white racist douchebags hate this game because it's got a black guy in it and they have zero concept of the nuances of why using this guy is bad. That does not invalidate the real reasons why this is shitty. I'm sick of white people using us for their bullshit and tokenizing us. Just stop it. you always emasculate black men. You make black women into lesbians and always put them in interracial relationships, making them masculine, ugly, and insufferable (latest example is that shitty Ark cartoon no one is talking about). You will NEVER see black lead characters in a relationship with another black character when it's created by a white person in the last 10 years. They will never have a black lesbian character be with another black woman. The only time you'll see it is when it's by a black creator. This is how we've been treated in media by the left for the last 20 years. It's annoying. And it keeps going with this game.\n\nThe fact that they played hip hop when controlling Yasuke should tell you everything. Hip hop was not invented until the early 1970's. Late 1960's possibly when it was still completely underground, but the point is that Yasuke has nothing to do with hip hop, but because he's black, of course these moronic virtue signalers did what they do best. Be complete unaware bigots and portray us through their own narrow lens.\n\nThis is just another point on the chart. I hope this studio closes for good. I hope the devs who tried to push back and fight against this or at least wanted to but couldn't find a better studio to work for. I hope all the who stand by this bullshit leave the industry. If you want to be political activist go to the people and places you claim you want to help. I know you wont because you're scared and you view us the same way you view a wild animal. Cowards. This is exhausting. They keep doing this and failing. And after failing multiple times, they keep doing it anyway.",

Except in this case, it's grossly inaccurate, revisionist in aligning with current cultural paradigms, and straight up offensive to the Japanese people. Yea make a Japanese GTA and people know what to expect. Make a history piece claiming to be heavily influenced and strives to be historically accurate, and the expectations are different.

It deserves hate, sure, but I've seen some of it and its just unreasonable. I think a lot of the outrage for this particular topic came from a Twitter clip of someone destroying things in a shrine.\n\nNow I will fully acknowledge that the political climate was very different back in 2009 and that Ubisoft's reputation was much better back then. If gameplay footage was released of Ezio climbing on top of crosses in a Basilica or back ejecting off of priceless frescoes depicting Jesus today, there probably would be more backlash than it got in 2009.\n\nI don't mean to invalidate Japan's concerns about it at all, I'm just saying that it may not be the reason. Their culture is very different, and I'm sure the last thing they want is more dipshit foreigners like Logan Paul and Johnny Somali disrespecting historic landmarks.",

They go ahead and bend the knee to a group of old people that probably don't play video games just so that they can get some extra money from Japan.

Had he been a great tactician but could not keep the soldiers willing to fight, and could not keep the civilians from abandoning the cause, the war would have been over. \n\nAlso, his strategy was fairly good. He knew how to avoid battles that would have destroyed the revolution. He knew that this was a costly war for Britain and that if the colonists can hold out and get some decisive wins, they will eventually give up. He knew how to effectively use the Fabian strategy and the saying, \"you can lose every battle and still win the war.\"\n\nThere's also his use of a spy network that won the war. He used ciphers and codes to get information while also feeding wrong information to the British. Without this we could have easily lost the war. \n\nFinally, there is also the fact that when he became president, he could have served for life, and had he turned into a dictatorship, it would have collapsed America and either had colonies leave the union, or have the British scoop them back up. Usually when military generals become the leader of the nation they turn into a dictatorship and the country does not last long.",

Like any social skill, it is dependent on the situation in which it is applied and I believe that it does not apply in this case. Hypothetically speaking let's suppose that a group has an issue with the idea of killing people, would it be reasonable for a game company to completely remove the ability to kill everyone in a game? Likewise in this situation, we have the issue where there is a foreigner killing native Japanese people would it be reasonable for Ubisoft to remove an entire character from their game just to satisfy compromise and tact? Then there is the issue of the fact that in previous games there was no compromise or tact in their games when it came to other religions. All of this comes into question whether there was compromise and tact in the first place. Ubisoft has not shown the same level of compromise or tact when it came to other cultures/religions but all of a sudden there was tact. What changed? The Japanese government stepped in. The only reason this ever got patched out was because the government stepped in. If there was no backlash from the government then there is a very high chance none of this would have been removed. The gaming industry fundamentally cannot have tact in this regard because there would always be a contradiction with another thing that is considered sensitive. It's either all or nothing. Games cannot function with this. Missions like No Russian wouldn't be allowed to exist because it would have been culturally insensitive in the US at the time along with the rise of the many mass shootings.\n\nThis then leads to the issue of integrity. Ubisoft had cultural experts on the team as they had claimed. This meant that they knew that these shrines were sacred like all the other holy and sacred places that they allowed players to desecrate. They knew everything about these shrines. Yet they went ahead and allowed this to happen? Well,l the only explanation here was that they either lied about having these experts or they knew and intentionally decided to allow this. After all it was fine for the other locations but not here. They were doing what they always did for other cultures. This is why I claim that they have no integrity since they did not have this mindset in the first place. \n\nAs for the second part, I could argue that it ruins immersion. After all the game was advertised to be as immersive as possible. From the realistic graphics to the physics of the game. In this case, e allowing for a destructible environment just adds to that immersion. It wouldn't make much sense to swing a sword at something that could easily be destroyed by that weapon. Personally, I always advocated for destructive environments because it just adds to the immersion.\n\nLastly, I want to say that it is not real. Nothing is getting destroyed and no one is getting hurt. These politicians are arguing that this will cause people to want to destroy this stuff in real life. But that is the same argument given in the West that video games will encourage people to commit mass shootings.",

By the time the US was born, Western European nations (or their predecessors) and/or the Christian population in conquered territories had about a 1000 years of history fighting with their Muslim neighbors to the east and south. In these wars BOTH sides repeatedly proved they prefer \"cruelty and apparently outright extermination efforts\", especially when they believe they have the upper hand. Does the Armenian genocide ring a bell?\n\nAnd they aren't antagonistic towards the rest of the Muslim nations where such geopolitical tension doesn't exist.\n\nAlso, I'd be pretty curious if you'd take the same approach with far right terrorism as well? If Western states weren't so antagonistic toward far right extremists, the number of terror attacks would surely drop, right? \n\nThe problem is that the values of these extremists are so different from the mainstream Western views that the West either has to tolerate/adopt values which are unacceptable or the extremists will complain that the West is soooo antagonistic.",

                "body": "Japan was going to surrender inevitably with the Soviets invading Manchuria, Sakhalin, and Kuril Islands. The walls were closing in. A naval blockade would've been enough to force surrender. The United States didn't want the Soviets to get credit for it or influence over Japan, in addition to the fact that the US wanted to flex the new bomb they just made, so they manufactured an excuse to use it, that way they could swoop in, take all the credit, and occupy Japan themselves. All the while exacting their revenge for Pearl Harbor and scaring the Soviets off with the bomb. The idea that Japan wouldn't have surrendered as they were getting attacked from every direction with hopeless odds is laughable.\n\n\nEdit: since this guy blocked me and I took too much time typing this out I'm going to post my other reply here:\n\nI'd love for you to explain why a number of the highest ranking people in the US military completely disagreed that the bombs were necessary because they almost universally viewed Japan as being defeated by that point. \n\n> Assistant Secretary Bard was convinced that a standard bombardment and naval blockade would be enough to force Japan into surrendering. Even more, he had seen signs for weeks that the Japanese were actually already looking for a way out of the war. His idea was for the United States to tell the Japanese about the bomb, the impending Soviet entry into the war, and the fair treatment that citizens and the Emperor would receive at the coming Big Three conference. Before the bombing occurred, Bard pleaded with Truman to neither drop the bombs (at least not without warning the population first) nor to invade the entire country, proposing to stop the bloodshed.\n\n> Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir The White House Years: In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly, because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives\n\n\n> Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet), Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr. (Commander of the US Third Fleet), and even the man in charge of all strategic air operations against the Japanese home islands, then-Major General Curtis LeMay\n\n> The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan.\n\n-- Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz\n\n> The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons ... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.\n\n-- Truman's Chief of Staff William Leahy\n\nWhat you are doing is parroting excuses that were designed to justify the use of a weapon that even the most senior officers in the military at the time viewed as being unjustifiable. The idea that Japan was not going to surrender without the use of those bombs was a lie then and that has only been proven consistently with any information that's come out since then.",

        "text": "I want to caveat this up front by saying I was really excited for the release of AC Shadows and think it is a massive improvement over Valhalla especially. I’m thrilled that it’s having such a positive reception and have enormous respect for the devs who clearly put their hearts and souls into it. However, I’m 10 hours so far and I’m just… not really having fun? \n\nNaoue and Yasuke are compelling characters and I love how deeply we get to know them - particularly Naoue. The story also makes a lot of sense and at no point am I confused about my character’s motivations. Then there’s the stunning visuals and the dense, rich environment. I’m constantly amazed at how lush the flora is. Despite all this though, I wouldn’t say that I’m “having fun” playing the game and I can’t quite put my finger on why that is. \n\nI have a few theories:\n\n1. Combat with Naoue - I get that she’s a stealth character, but inevitably you get stuck in combat encounters from time to time and they’re incredibly repetitive. I’m sure that will change in the later game once I unlock more abilities, but I have yet to have a “holysh*t that was so f**king cool” moment in combat like I did in Odyssey (Spartan kicking an enemy off a cliff will never get old).\n\n2. Lack of fun side quests - This has been raised in this sub already, but I really miss the lighthearted and varied side quests that the other ACs have had. They help deepen your connection to the land and its people, and give a much-needed break from the seriousness of the main storyline. From what I understand, Naoue has barely left Iga in her life. Surely connecting with other regions and communities should be an integral part of her journey?\n\n3. Meditation breaks - I’m 50/50 on these. On the one hand, I love the opportunities to learn more about Iga and the events leading up to the present day. On the other hand, I find them too long and the addition of gameplay within them takes me out of the groove of whatever I was doing before. \n\n4. Unrewarding exploration - This has also been mentioned in this sub so I won’t dwell on it, but I don’t have the same drive to explore every corner of the map like I do with, say, Breath of the Wild or even Hogwarts Legacy (which has its own problems with repetitive gameplay).\n\nTo end on a positive note, I’m still really happy with the game and think it was a massive step forward for Ubisoft. After so many failures they needed a home run with this game and they delivered. I can’t give enough credit to the dev teams for what they produced. I like the game a lot but I hope they make a few changes so I can start loving it. \n\nI’m curious to hear what you all think. Am I missing something here?",

Ironically the things you find most boring are the parts where I have most fun. \n\nI love the combat, it’s my personal favorite in the entire franchise, it’s deliberate, quick and satisfying. If you find it boring I recommend changing the difficulty to expert and not relying too much on an (early) dodge, parry everything you can parry and when the red attack does come dodge it last moment.\n\nI really liked the Kuji-kiri memories there’s only a few of them and after it just becomes like a normal activity, I thought it was great way to slowly give us pieces of Naoe history. \n\nFor exploration, I think the rewards are pretty good, especially cause it’s not as bloated as previous games. Yeah sure sometimes you just run into a shrine, temple or viewing point which gameplay wise isn’t as rewarding as a castle, legendary chest, tomb or parkour run, but you know just mastery points are also pretty useful. Regardless I’ve found so far my drive for exploration is mainly coming from genuinely just wanting to see more of the world rather than a new katana or tanto. \n\nFor side quests, yeah we’ve had better. But the quests you are looking for they are there, might just a while before you run into them.",

Hunting legendary beasts, finding and slaying mythological creatures, helping old people with their sex problems. The world felt ALIVE and interesting. It was exciting exploring every nook and cranny. Shadows feels mundane, and empty in this regard. I also feel like Shadows lacks memorable boss fights, though I'm only 20 hours in, so that might get proven wrong. So far the gameplay loop is just: go to castle, slay/find x, loot legendary equipment, continue.\nIdk, it feels repetitive and bland. Even Valhalla was more interesting with it's mysteries in this regard, and that was already a massive step down from Odyssey IMO.\nGraphics and combat is awesome tho",

I've hit every viewpoint & question mark on the map in the first 2 provinces.\n\nExploration isn't very rewarding in the sense that besides the question marks on the map that lead to kofuns or anything, there's no real point in going off the beaten path, since exploring in forest areas is difficult since you can't climb much of it & there's no loot out there. The devs intended for us to stay on the roads, so that makes sense, but it is somewhat of a let down personally.\n\nYou can Spartan kick enemies with Yasuke, there's even a trophy for it, called \"This is Japan, actually\".\n\nI agree with the side quests, Odyssey had so many random quests that were lighthearted & different from the main story, like that one where you had to find ingredients to make essentially Viagra for this woman to give to her lover, while so far most of the side jobs in this game are about bandits, & the occasional fetch quest. Granted, I haven't done too many of them so that may change. This game does seem to be darker than Odyssey, so I can't say it's super unexpected.\n\nLots of QoL stuff got removed which is a confusing choice from the devs, like the auto horse riding to your destination. Hopefully they put that back.\n\nI just finished act 1 in the story, the rest of my play time has been exploring/clearing castles & I've been having a blast with the combat, particularly Naoe's. I think Shadows is easily a top 5 AC game, but it's definitely not perfect.",

I'm still hoofing it with a smile because the landscape and the graphics make it a soothing experience for me.\n\nYes, there are a number of shortcomings. Certain accessibility features from Valhalla are gone, which should honestly become another staple of the series with the amount of tweaks we could make for our individual experiences.\n\nThe main quest started off very strong, but it ends up just kinda... Tapering off. It is very much a front-loaded experience in that regard, as the narrative loses momentum as the story goes on when it should be the opposite. I'm not in act 3 yet since I'm mostly doing the side targets, knowledge points, etc. But I've seen enough comments on the story that the stakes don't escalate, which past games did. Each new major target had more sway throughout the region, which meant targeting them was more difficult, but the reward had a larger impact. I get the sense that is not the case in this game. Granted, this is also a consequence of having such a massive game world. Not to mention, they've been leaning harder into player agency. This isn't a bad thing, but it does get to a point where it detracts from the overall concept of raising the stakes.' I'm not even going to talk about the lack of moral ambiguity of the targets. They comic book villains, and therefore, less interesting. Delving into the moral grayness of their machinations used to be interesting. Not so for me, at least so far.\n\nBut the gameplay makes up for it, for me, at least. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, and that's totally fine. A few additional tweaks and smaller features here and there can improve on this. It's up to the post-launch team if the effort is worth doing now or taking notes and pushing it higher up the priority list for the next game.\n\nAll in all, I think the next cluster of games should dial back on the extreme elements of their approach to certain aspects. The maps don't need to be this big. It increases the risk of burnout, as players will just get frustrated with having to cross large portions of the map because they haven't been to that region yet and don't have fast travel points. A tighter narrative doesn't have to mean reducing player agency and will certainly help with creating a narrative that shows the escalating intensity of events and possibly the effect such stress can have on the characters. AC games thrived when the story was as much about the character's personal experience and growth as it was about the events.\n\nI love the AC franchise, and I very much want it to keep going. Shadows is a step in the right direction in many areas. But it still struggles with some of the other issues the franchise has. If Ubisoft continues on this trend of continuing to in stages without compromising in other areas, we might finally get a damn good AC game that we've been looking forward to since AC2 and Black Flag.",

I find Valhalla is still my fave, followed by Odyssey, then Origins for its incredible story, then Shadows.\n\nI find the combat is not as fun for me as Valhalla’s. It’s more linear, and you have less control. You chain skills that do the combat for you, giving you the illusion of control, but really you are just guiding the character. Valhalla’s and even Odysseys combat was much more meaningful and controlled by the player.\n\nI do not enjoy the more linear traveling. I miss being able to cut across the map, climbing any obstacle in my path, and finding cool things along the way! You are more forced along the games chosen path, instead of your own. Though the game is beautiful, so I do enjoy the paths to an extent. There is much less loot in the world as well. I’m constantly scanning for loot like you would in Valhalla, yet the world is empty. It’s more a painted canvas than an explorable world.\n\nI really miss the torches! Exploring tombs is much less fun in all the darkness. I light all the candles I see, but I find I accidentally destroy more than I light, especially with Yasuke, the big oaf!\n\nThe story was good at first, but it’s trailed off. I was doing all the side quests and hideout quests, that the story disappeared for me. I had to force myself back into the main quests to try and find the story again.\n\nIt’s a pretty good game, and definitely a beautiful game, but not the best. I find myself yearning to play Valhalla again, as I play shadows.\n\nEdit: I also dislike the cities. In previous games the cities were bustling!

                "body": "Bro, i feel the same and i've been yapping about it on comment sections for a week now!! I've found for me, aside from the side quests and mostly bland exploration loop, i strongly believe the issue is the difficulty, specifically for combat and stealth. To preface this, the game is very foccussed on assassination targets through intel gathering and a lot of combat/stealth through raiding castles, roaming mini bosses and side activities that build up your charcater as a shinobi/samurai as well as your league through the hideout mechanic. On paper, i must say i LOVE this focussed design. Almost everything you do is steered towards these core themes, the loop is never all over the place. This makes actual gameplay be the focus and highlight of your experience rather than just narrative and open world visuals/design! The challenge with this though, is your core gameplay elements need to be really good because you don't have much else to rely on to keep the player engaged after they have seen all the beauty and gone through the genral narrative. \n\nThis i believe is where you start to see the flaws. Don't get me wrong, like you said, the gameplay is greatly improved from previous AC, especially the stealth and combat! But i think it's held back by UBI's design that has them nerfing the experience for the sake of accessibility. IMO, they go over board with this that even when they do make something really good, they hold it back and are afraid to press into the mechanic. Basically, what im saying is the difficulty for both stealth and combat is holding the game back and is probably why you and i feel not so engaged. They have introduced very cool gameplay elements for both combat and stealth. For stealth (on expert) enemies seem smarter and more dynamic. For combat in general, the variety is not just good, but enemies are dynamic in how they can attack and respond to you, The player also has a very diverse and cool pool of combos/weapons they can use that synergize well with abilities. There's so much you can do at anytime! \n\nAgain though, even on expert, all these rather dynamic elements are nerfed. For expert stealth, enemies have good field of vision and detection speed but their hearing is so limited! You can basically break stuff around them and they only react if you are really close. You can run up and pretty much assassinate anyone before they go into attack mode and the only time you have to worry about it is if someone else will see you. This though, i get, it's fun to do running assassinations and there's at least enemies that will deny your assassinations if they see you coming. I like that! The main issue i have for stealth is that there's no incentive to use the new cool mechanics like shadows, prone and dynamic hiding spots. You don't even need to use the grab mechanic or hide bodies because enemies seem to not care that much if they spot a dead body and it's also very easy to lose guards after they spot you. You can be in a fight, spin the block and hide in a bush and you are gone! They will search for like a minute and then go right back to normal like nothing happened. It often feels like you just pressed the reset button. Imo, they need to make a new 'master' stealth difficulty that keeps the detection speeds and field of vision of expert, but makes it so that if guards see you, more than one dead body or are alerted by a servant, they do more thorough searches and remian in a moderate alert status when they can't find you.  Basically, guards should not just go back to normal when they know you are around but not exactly where. Something like what MGSV did with the different alert levels that persisted for a good amount of time and added a new layer to stealth. You can still be in stealth but guards kinda know you are around, which made things interesting and more engaging!\n\nFor expert combat, like i said, enemies can be very dynamic and have a pool of moves that seem to be designed to keep you engaged. The problem here is even on expert and in general, enemies are slow, over telegraphed, have ridiculously generous parry windows and are generally not aggressive. There is however a system where the aggressivness of SOME higher rank enemies is hightened when it's a one on one, but still the other issues i mentioned persist. This is all made more apparent when you unlock a few abilities and make even a basic build. You end up so OP that it breaks combat that even bosses the game hypes up become a breeze. They need a 'master' combat difficulty that keeps the damage values of expert but increases enemy speed, aggression, tightens the parry windows and overal dynamism!",

It’s significantly more boring to go 1v1 with Naoe than Yasuke. I like to just charge inte castles with Yasuke and mow down enemies but with Naoe it takes forever to kill 2 samurai in combat so it gets boring but her stealth is really fun. Although the game gets ridiculously easy when you finish Nobutsunas side quest and get that katana for Yasuke, at that point you can just spam hit and you will kill every enemy in a 15v1 within 2-3 minutes.\n\nAlthough the ending kind of pissed me of since I thought it was the beginning of another quest but it just left on a cliffhanger (kind of). I do love Yasukes story and especially how they tie in certain elements that kind of connect to Naoes story too. Going of that I would like to see a DLC or game of Yasuke going back to Portugal. \n\nThe only thing that suck so far is the knowledge points system because I don’t like going to 50 temples just to pick up 3 scrolls or pray at 4 shrines for 1 point. I did in fact spend hours earlier today just doing that. \n\nAnyway the game is amazing and the best AC I have played since origins.",

That led to me getting spotted and dying a lot, which reduced the fun. (Also, I am playing with Japanese text and voice. So I am only maybe understanding it 40%. So that may also subtract from the fun. Lol.)\n\nBut I think it's a welcome change. While it is extremely challenging when compared to other AC games on Expert, it adds realism to it. It does sometimes get frustrating to be \"seen\" by everyone all the time even with the cover of night and rooftop.\n\nThe combat is like two-hit kill most of the time. I need to be very careful.\n\nI think I am around 20 hours in and I haven't got to Yasuke yet. So maybe I am taking it too slowly. I wouldn't say I am \"bored\" in any way. In fact, I was playing it non-stop for hours for straight 2 days. But I wasn't deeply drawn into it either. I would say I am more \"addicted\" to Valhalla and Odyssey at the time than this now. (And those were less than a year ago for me.)\n\nI feel like a large part of the system is inherited from Mirage. That game is a two-edged sword for me. There was as much to be loved as to be hated. But it was a good game overall. \n\nAs I would say for almost every Assassin's Creed game, because I am a fan and always very forgiving for Ubisoft, it takes some getting used to. I would personally treat each as a separate game to play, not from a series, as there are too many inconsistency. That would feel better.\n\nAnd somehow they just love to change the control layout for every single game, and you can't really \"customize it back\" as the controls are all intertwined. If you don't play it with default settings, it will feel buggy. That part definitely needs getting used to. My only real complaint. \n\nOn a side note, it has a feeling of Ghost of Tsushima and Tenchu from decades ago, which are both very good. Very ninja-ish and ancient Japanese, from an entertainment pov.\nI particularly like the presentation of the prologue. It feels very much like a Japanese Samurai drama/movie.\n\nOverall, it's a game I am enjoying, but it's not the most satisfying. And I look forward to patches as bugs, as always, are \"bugging\" me all the time.",

I like the backstory from the meditations and so on. This time around the game has been done in a fashion that's easy to grasp for me without questioning the continuity. Everything makes sense and I love it!\nAs for the unrewarding exploration, I have got to say that if there's something Ubisoft still has to get a grasp of it's balancing the loot. Having the highest tier armor essentially from the getgo basically renders everything else useless and there is tons of loot. While some is useful for the looks, most of them are just material source. And taking them apart to extract materials is tediously terrible.\nI'd say that Odyssey is still my favourite, but it's mostly because of the mythology and Kassandra, who is, in my opinion, so well executed and voiced and everything, that she's probably not going to be topped anytime soon.",

On the one hand, I love the opportunities to learn more about Iga and the events leading up to the present day. On the other hand, I find them too long and the addition of gameplay within them takes me out of the groove of whatever I was doing before.\n\ndisagree. The back story is such a big part of giving Naoe's motivation and background. you talk about wanting a deeper connection, and then complain they are too long\n\n>Unrewarding exploration \n\nAgain, whaaat. I am starting to think you have not realised how the game works especially the side content.. \n\nWhen you explore the map and get to a town, hold L2 to focus and pan around slowly, look for white glowing dots, blue glowing dots, then follow the blue ones.. they open up side activities, new people to hunt. And that is the reward for exploration\n\n**your comments about lack of side content and unrewarding exploration makes me think you have not actually found the \"focus\" button.. that would explain both situations. Its not like previous AC's where you spend the game icon jumping. In this you have to actually look for the side missions and stories**",

It was a ridiculously cool experience. \n\nI got odyssey on sale as well and, again, I was blown away. I loved the world and the characters, same as with Origins. \n\nValhalla I did pre order and played the moment it went live in PS, I was on among us with a bunch of friends and still booted the game up on the side cause I was THAT excited for it. This game I have over 110 hours on and never even finished the main story. I have don’t SO many side quests and such and I had a ton of fun. The world was cool and the characters were ok for the most part. I didn’t get that same connection as I did with Origins and Odyssey (mainly Odyssey tbh) I still think about both those games to this day on random occasions. Valhalla sometimes comes up even though it’s the one I have spent the most time in. I still plan on going in and finishing it but I think the Norse mythology was a bit too much for me. I enjoy the supernatural aspects of the game but I think Valhalla was too focused on it. \n\nShadows I feel 0 connection to the world. So far I have only played as Yasuke in the intro but so I can’t speak on him much, he seemed fine. Naoe is ok was well. The characters in the game so far are just ok. I felt a similar was with the character in Valhalla but I still enjoyed those more than these. The world seems vast and detailed enough, the technical state of the world isn’t my problem, I just don’t have any real desire to explore it.\n\nPersonally, I think the world feels too derivative to Ghosts of Tsushima and that might be why I don’t really feel that desire to go and explore it. \n\nNot saying the game is bad at all. I’m sure it’s great for the right person. I’ll still be playing it for a while I think but it’s nothing to write home about. Unless something drastic changes in the gameplay, I won’t ever be replaying this one.",

Especially bc his kick is even more insane then the spartan kick lol. \n\nAs for naoe, if getting into combat is an issue for you just turn on guarantee assassination and you can stealth a whole area no problem! I personally can still clear areas without issues on expert without guarantee assassination on, it just takes longer and different approaches. Also combat for naoe def opens up as she unlocks more abilities, I play on normal because I’d rather finish fights fast then deal with bullet sponge enemies and honestly for me the combat has been a blast with naoe, her parry focus play style is addicting and using all her tools to help your fight makes it alot better too.\n\nMeditation story line is only 4 of them do they don’t drag fortunately.  So it’s only something early on into the game \n\nAs for exploration, I feel the opposite. I stumbled across a couple areas that ended with me getting really cool loot by just exploring something that wasn’t on the map, while I don’t do it all the time, if someplace looks interesting enough I’ll check it out and usually I’m rewarded with something cool.\n\nHonestly I think a lot of these things that make you feel like your not having as much fun comes more from personal preference. Odyssey was a blast to play but too long for me, Valhalla failed to catch my interest at all, but shadows I’ve been having fun from the start\n\nHoping that you start having more fun sooner once you unlock more stuff and things open up for you. Def play with the difficulty for things and highly recommend expert stealth if you aren’t playing that already, it’s super addicting in my opinion.",

The game is incredibly emotionally fulfilling that way\n\nThe flashbacks are also really heartfelt and excellent backstory, they don't last too long and they're completely optional. I love finding the meditation spots. I also love praying at shrines, or finding animals to sketch. \n\nAgain it really helps hearing her in my headphones when she passes by something interesting and comments on it because it makes me stop.",

The characters I didn't care about and the game doesn't try to make me care about. It just throws them in, expecting me to know who they are.\n\nExploration is fun for the first 20h, and then it becomes very samey, the rewards are very bad and having a gear system with colored gear and almost like a looter shooter doesn't help. It would have been better to have a gear system like in Dark Souls, where you have a couple of unique gear sets and then you can upgrade it using some materials. With the current gear system, I used the upgrading mechanic once.\n\nThe scout system is incredibly stupid. Either give me markers or just say: this person is in this city, rumors say he has a red house with a white chimney. \n\nThe base management is cool, but I wish they would have done more with it.\n\nYasuke should have been a character like Aya in Origins. \n\nOverall, it was a fun game, better than the last big 3  but it has some faults that they need to work on.\n\nMy rating would be 7/10\n\nAlso, why is there level scaling?

Overall probably the best of the 4 on avg - i love Origins equally but that's for Bayek acting and sheer exotic beauty of the world, gameplay is not as good.\n\nLove the tone, it aims at Japan - not ossified Kurosawa cliches adopted by Hollywood for people to recognise and tag each other in screenshots. For the same reason i disliked Odyssey and Vallhalla trying to be modern/humourous take on Greece and HollywoodViking with a sprinkle of pop-academia, complete with Marvel Thor leaning Isu armour.\n\nLove the detail that has gone into samurai and shinobi clans. They could improve the rationale of whose castles  are you raiding and why though, imo 'THEY'RE AN ACTIVITY OUTPOST' is cheap and stale.\n\nIt does still suffer from grind, filler content and collectathons to some degree but it's better at not pushing it as a gamey centrepiece.

Combat and stealth has gotten more fun at higher levels but the rest of the game kinda doesn’t really improve. A lot is just my disappointment of not having old features in this game as I think they would really improve it.\n\nIn certain parts of the map, the trees are pretty tall, this would have been perfect to reintroduce tree parkour like ac3. Some of the hills that are hard to climb could have easier paths up in the trees. Some of the bandit camps should be more hidden in the woods instead of always being in clearings and this adds elevation to stealth. If there aren’t many buildings for parkour, why not have trees take that over.\n\nThe story >!just sets up for dlc, most of the other games have a more personal goal that leads to the protagonist getting involved with a bigger goal. This game ends right before getting into what is usually the interesting part of the other games!<. I really miss the little conversations as they give some importance to the big kills instead of just being random names.\n\nThe castles feel very copied. They got the look right but it is generally thought that Japanese castles were very maze like with many dead ends and only a few or a single correct path through them with tight corridors. This is not reflected at all in the game as most castles have large open areas with multiple paths inside. This worked better in odyssey as they were just big houses instead of full on castles.\n\nI have always enjoyed the boat combat as it is a replayed way to have fights and get look as long as it isn’t too forced. Japan had water and pretty unique ships at the time, I think an odyssey level boat combat would have been nice, tho people seemed to really complain about it before.",

Even without this problem it would suffer from pacing because Ubisoft seems to love their never ending target lists and \"more faces than stories\" approach.

I’m playing a new game & I’m gonna complete all the DLC for the first time (only did Ireland last time). Having a living, breathing world to explore & interact with feels so good in comparison to Shadows.\n\nI think Shadows has solid combat, but I miss a lot about Valhalla. I love the variety of weapons and enemies in it. Love all the different finishers depending on the enemy you’re killing or the weapon you’re wielding. Appreciate the different skill lines to focus on depending on how I want to play (sneaky assassin with daggers, quick melee/bow user who implements poison/fire, heavy hitter with two-handed axe, or some hybrid of all of ‘em). Love the abilities.\n\nAnd there is just so much to do in Valhalla. I can wander and stumble upon interesting things. I can find legendary beasts to take down or bosses to fight. I can hunt animals & catch fish. I can spend time doing river raids with a crew I build, I can visit cities and play Orlog or drinking games, I can experience Norse mythology and fight gods. I can help a little boy who’s lost his whole family build a cairn or force a (literally) shitty archer to take a bath. And when I come upon caves, old assassins hideouts, or even just random cottages, there are often environmental puzzles to navigate if I want to proceed. Some get repetitive (cottages), but old assassin hideouts and some other areas had unique designs that made them interesting to complete. I really wish Shadows had that. Haven’t explored too many kofuns, but the ones I did felt/looked the exact same and had no puzzles at all.\n\nIt’s crazy because I see lots of people saying Shadows is better than Valhalla in particular (I didn’t realize Valhalla was so disliked until Shadows came out, actually lol), but while I see some definite improvements in certain aspects, I can’t help but feel like Valhalla is just more fun to play.",

        "title": "Shadows' stealth system is so fun to break, I love this.",
        "text": "Let me start by saying that the stealth in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is incredibly fun. I’m playing on expert difficulty, and it’s just as enjoyable as Mirage was for me. I’m loving all the improvements, like the Splinter Cell-inspired shadow system, the ability to go prone, the grapple, and the increased enemy field of vision on expert. Bringing back double assassinations with Tanto was fantastic. No complaints about the stealth at all.\n\nAt first I thought Expert was hard, until I realized this game gives you plenty of ways to break it in half.\n\nNaoe’s sheer speed and agility make it incredibly easy to escape when caught. You can quickly get out of the red alert state and hide back in bushes, tall grass, haystacks, or the shadows with minimal effort. Even in a flat field, you can circle around them and take them all out one by one with hit-and-run tactics, it's addicting.\n\nAnother big component of this is that, while enemies *can* spot you more easily on rooftops, they don’t have many ways to come get you. They can’t climb (which I guess makes sense for the ones in armor), and as far as I can tell, there aren’t any ladders for them to use either—unlike previous games in the series. Yeah, they have archers and riflemen, but they're not a threat, and can juked and taken out easily.\n\nThis leads to some absolutely *hilarious* situations. I’ve been chased by five enemies, climbed onto a one-story building, gone prone or moved to the other side of the rooftop to lose them, air assassinated one or two, and then watched as the remaining guards *rediscovered* me. Then I’d climb up the same building *again*, lose them *again*, assassinate another guard, and repeat the cycle. It’s so absurd that I can’t help but love it.\n\nAnother funny thing the AI does, is that because they can't climb rooftops, if they spot you on the rooftop and go into their yellow altered state, they have a habit of checking the interior of the building you're on top of. As if they saw you in there lol.\n\nOn top of all this, getting caught doesn’t feel like a big deal. At worst, enemies might call their nearby friends and start a search party, preemptively checking hiding spots like bushes—but even then, it doesn’t make them any harder to assassinate. And It’s still easy to lure them into isolated spots where they can be taken out unnoticed, especially given how enemy bases and castles are designed.\n\nAnd then there’s how stealth can break combat. If an enemy is too strong—say, one of those heavily armored foes with tons of health—you can just run away until they lose sight of you, sneak attack to take a good chunk of their health, run away again, and repeat until they’re dead. This strategy works surprisingly well, even on tougher enemies like Samurai Daisho who can’t be assassinated in one hit.\n\nI also find it really funny how you can sometimes have full on combat with somebody, metal clasing with loud grunts & yelling, and other enemies like 15 feet away can't hear what's going on. \n\nAnd I haven't even mentiond the tools like the kunai, the classic smoke bombs, bells, shuriken.\n\nAgain, I have to stress—I’m *not* complaining. I’m having an absolute blast just playing around with the mechanics and tools the game provides. It's incredibly entertaining. I just thought it was worth pointing out how easily exploitable, if you can even call it that, the stealth can be. It really amuses me. And I'm still kinda early in game, so for all I know they'll add more challenges. \n\nWasn't too hot on the game at first, but I'm really getting into the groove of it now, this is pretty sick.",

Well, I don't think it's controversial to say that the pacing is terrible. \n\nI will definitely make it to the credits, but it's funny how the game went from something I couldn't wait to play, to something I have to force myself to complete, just after the 30 hours mark.\n\nAnyone else?",

Beautiful game & I like Naoe & Yasuke, but the plodding pacing and lack of meaningful things to do when I'm not engaging with the main story completely put me off after 20ish hours. If they were going to go this route, there was genuinely no reason for this to not be more contained and linear in the vein of Mirage or AC Brotherhood instead of open world like Odyssey.

I recommend Expert difficulty with minimal hud once you get your bearings. \nThe story has a couple great moments but overall I've found it to be weaker when compared to previous titles. While Naoe and Yasuke are quite likeable, there really have not been as many memorable missions or characters (including the villains) so far. Some cutscenes also have somewhat stiff animation which breaks the immersion at times. What I wouldn't give to have an AC where every cutscenes is as well made as the fireside chat between Eivor and Basim! Now that was memorable. Shadows has so far been a good game, definitely with flaws, and I don't think I've experienced burnout in my journey so far.

I feel like the combat focus was more fitting to the setting/character, and they changed it up enough for it to feel a bit more digestible.

I'm on my fifth unknown organization and have no fucking idea why I'm killing them or who they or their organization are. Just another marked as killed. Maybe you'll find out at some point, logically, but it all feels poorly paced. Every time I jump back in I can't remember the story or have much of an urge to dig out what I'm going to do next, so I mostly just walk around and clear camps and castles, which sets the AC fatigue in a bit.

I would have liked a mechanic like a \" blacksmith's box\" (DS1) that would allow you to upgrade things at hideouts  rather than every time you get another couple levels having to go to the main base.\n\nBase buildings also a cool idea but after a point, it's purely cosmetic.\n\nIt became a game of, \"just get to this point\", so I don't have to deal with it.\n\n  \nIt's certainly very fun at times but I think the reviews were very generous.",

I know those games are dated, but how the fuck did Ubisoft regress story-wise and have lacking side quests. As a huge AC fan since the beginning, I'm gonna try getting through the rest after Origins but I'm worried they won't be nearly as good at drawing me in like the original titles 😕",

I never once faced a boss where i was like oh damnn.  On expert, all my deaths were just like either being underleveled in an area and getting one shotted or like getting mobbed by so many enemies that i couldnt block or dodge them all.  Ik bosses arent like the main mechanic in AC, but cmon like give us a few challenge bosses. I really liked the witches/legendary animals in valhalla.  Or (ik this comparison gets old) but like got where a legendary samurai u fought actually felt like a proper katana showdown where u had to really time everything well and respond accordingly. The main combat loop in shadows just felt like hack, slash, oh hes blocking better charge up a heavy attack, dodge red parry blue and regular attacks, repeat, whether it was just a regular enemy or a leader \"boss\"",

This game relies a lot on actually understanding the connections (no shame here - took me a while too not just running from target to target without even really understanding why.)\n\n- This comes to my second point: it gets overwhelming fast with all those Japanese terms like “Daimyo” or what else. The glossary (don’t know the English word in the game - you know in the menu on the far right, where also the tutorials are etc.) will contain a lot of useful information.\n\n- Just roam around a while! Maybe go to another region and see what’s happening there. You can also turn on showing unknown quests etc. at the map.\n\nThere are so many interesting stories everywhere, you just need to find them. Maybe take a little break if you feel so burnt out, but maybe these hints could help you or other people.",

The one territory that felt different was the one where you had to go on a clue hunt to figure out who the traitor to the one woman was (can’t even remember her name). The entire thing was just… go to new place, do couple fetch quest, a couple kill quests, obvious betrayal, and pick leader, go home and put the raven statue on the map…. Rinse and repeat.\n\n    I didn’t play the dlc it’s the first AC game I didn’t get any possible dlc for. I didn’t even do the fallen tombs or whatever or any free post launch content because I disliked it so much.  Even the gear system was super watered down, also the skill tree was massive for no real reason forcing u to unlock random BS and a bunch of useless stuff. Odysseys abilities were more “magical/isu” but they were still better. Combat was decent but there was 0 stealth.\n\nI haven’t played shadows and might not even, they need to figure out how to create a compelling story and meaningful side content rather than a predictable and boring story and a bunch of fetch quests or lame puzzles or prayer monuments.  Idc if the map is much smaller as long as it’s filled with awesome stuff. \n\n  I hope hexa is better than what I hear about shadows. Also I’d love a game set in the Human Isu War playing as a hybrid or something, go full on magical with it and show what started it all.

The mission structure reminds me of Ghost Recon Wildlands, where the targets were just names on a list and your reason for going after them was that they're bad, but each still had some charm. With Shadows I would have liked a linear approach to the story that atleast establishes some relation other than the initial encounter with the targets, so the villains get room to grow, and so does your hate for them. Best example for this would be the templars of AC 3. \n\nI'm still cautiously optimistic that Shadows can wow me with the characters before it ends, but chances of that happening are looking slim. The fact that the most memorable target I've killed yet was a guy taxing people by collecting their shit says enough about how interesting the villains in the game are.\n\nHaving the targets connected in a linear manner, where you discover the whereabouts of one after killing the other, with some relationship between the targets themselves would've been cool. Imagine if a main target is constantly on the hunt for you as well, as you're assassinating his mates one by one. And I don't mean it in a way that the phylakes or mercenaries were, but rather properly woven into the story and cutscenes, where you could see the \"bond\" growing till the climax. Just having one such villain who has a personal relationship with the player character would have elevated the experience (Vaas comes to mind as I write this).",

You do meet the author of one of the primary sources that they used to write the book, which is a great little Easter egg. \n\nWhile historical fiction, but with a strong lean to historical, the classic *Shogun* by James Clavell is insanely good. Their names are changed in *Shogun*, but we do meet many of the relevant characters from that story in the game, which has made the story very fun for me. Then events of *Shogun* take place after the events of AC (I presume but I haven’t fully beaten it yet). It picks up maybe a decade after Akechi Mitsuihide dies… which, I’m unsure if that’s in the game or not. Part of what makes *Shogun* so damn good is how well it immerses you in and teaches you about feudal Japan.",

AND you have mini games like orlog and drinking.\n\n\n\nMy point is, Valhalla has a ton of stuff to add variety to the game flow, while Shadows is just the same stealth and the same combat, with side activities that are mostly braindead simple.

After you kill the first three shinbakufu, the rest don't really have any plot relevance. You kill them, they don't give you any info about the box or the identities of the other members, and you move on.\n\n\nValhalla's main story has multiple plot threads. Taking England region by region, hunting down the order with Hytham, character drama with Sigurd resenting you for taking charge, Isu/mythological stuff with Basim. Most importantly, all of the plot threads in the base game feel like they reach a satisfying conclusion, while the DLCs are just fun bonus stories. In Shadows, the main plot is just killing Shinbakufu targets that feel completely isolated from each other, and it ends up not even getting properly resolved. Naoe's journey ends up REALLY not getting resolved, and Yasuke's journey feels extremely underdeveloped. Shadows feels like the prologue to a story, and it seems like the meat of the story is gonna be sold as DLC.",

I'm a little tired of massive open-world games these days, it just feels like wasted space and effort in the wrong place. Most games could probably be half the size, and would be better for it. Elden Ring, Horizon 2, and modern AC games would all be less repetitive if they were smaller.  I know some people love this, but seriously these huge high-fidelity maps are a big part of the reason that game development is so expensive and so many AAA titles play it safe.\n\nAC Shadows is cool, but my personal recommendation is to wait for a sale. I think it's a bit soulless, trying to do too many things, appeal to too many types of players, and homage too many sources. This leaves the game spread thin narratively, mechanically, and stylistically, in my opinion. It's not bad; the stealth and graphics are really great, but everything else I just don't find compelling. Your mileage may vary, of course, and if you're a huge fan of the RPG games, Ubisoft games, or historical Japan you're more likely to enjoy it. If you have any specific questions, I can try to answer them as honestly as possible, but I've only played eight hours. Honestly, need I say more than that?",

        "text": "Super unpopular opinion, I'm about 20 hours into Shadows right now and I have to admit-- I'm not having as much fun with the series as I used to. I really loved Mirage, it was super enjoyable (the story too). I disliked Valhalla (as stealth was so bad in that game), and I really enjoyed Odyssey. I think scenery wise, I really *really* loved Odyssey the most. Odyssey was the peak of these AC RPG style type of games. If I'm in the mood for parkour, I boot up AC Unity, but I really think I enjoy the beautiful fantasy-like story of Odyssey. Not to mention, the speed of zooming across and stealthing everyone was super fun in that game. Origins comes close. \n\nHowever, some of my biggest gripes in Shadows is the story, the attempts at fitting the two protagonists into one game and the scenery. Exploration isn't as breathtaking as Odyssey. While I agree that this is the best attempt at stealth in the new AC-RPG games, it's not like it's anything near how great Unity got. Second, the main characters appear together in cutscenes, but I really hoped the story involved both of them fighting alongside one another-- which is exactly what I had hoped when I saw those cutscenes, but super let down when I realized only one appears each time as we were fighting them. Also, not sure if it's just me but the story is starting to feel super bland. I mean, Basim had an incredible backstory, but here, this is just some generic revenge story with Naoe. Yasuke's story feels much better, but I'm discouraged to play him since he can't do most of the things that \"assassins can.\" I understand that's the premise of the character and what Ubisoft was going for here, but it's damaging my opportunity to play as him in the \"free roam\" moments and only resorting to him for story purposes. \n\nAnyways, I think, overall, in the new era of AC games, Shadows is good, but not the best. I would have to say that-- scenery wise, Odyssey and Origins were always the height of the franchise, but this does come close. In terms of gameplay, it's probably 2nd imo, only after the fast-paced AC odyssey where I felt super liberating running through a fort and assassinating everyone super quickly. People may say \"oh aren't you doing the same thing over and over again?\" But honestly, don't we all resort to the same things in this game too? We hide in boxes, assassinate from rooftops and when everything fails we just resort to standing in the same bush, whistling and killing enemies from the same spot 50x over and over again. ",

I've said this a lot in this sub since it's release, but Odyssey to me felt like a parody that was making fun of AC more than anything. All it's historical characters were caricatures of themselves.\n\nComparing Socrates, the bumbling \"smart guy\" with a comically snarky tone to accounts of is real life counterpart (which I've studied extensively as a philosophy/history major) gives me whiplash. Then you see an almost perfect portrayal of Oda Nobunaga. For whatever reason Japan always seems to get special care from media creators. \n\nThe forts in Odyssey were all copy pasted while the castles in Shadows all feel like unique experiences ripe with stealth and parkour moments. \n\nKass/Alexios in particular were just completely unrelatable for me and more annoying than fun. Whereas Yasuke and Naoe feel like thought out, fleshed out characters. Admittedly, it takes some time to get familiarized with them but they get so much backstory, their motivations make sense and are consistent characters. I always feel like there's a lot more focus on the main story this time around whereas Odyssey's was just fetch quests. \n\nI do think there's a lot I wish was improved with Shadows, but so much actually has been that it really feels like a leap forward in tech. Keeping in mind that Quebec was always working on he heels of Montreal, but this time they seem to have gotten more ownership. They released the first truly next gen AC, implemented ray tracing including some homebrew stuff to make it run well on consoles, they developed one of the best weather systems I've seen in a game including seasons that completely change the entire map which is absolutely wild. \n\nThe destructible environments may not be new to games in general, but the way it's done in Shadows is phenomenal. One big example is let's say you get caught and hide in the bushes resulting in a fight. During that fight you cut the bushes down and now you can't use them to hide anymore because they're gone! Frozen water gives you different ways to approach the situation, whereas when it's thawed you can hide in it or find underwater paths into fortresses. Icicles fall from rooftops when you hit them. Running on ice makes you slide.\n\nThere's just so many fantastic details in this game I didn't find with Odyssey for example. I really feel like part of it is just personal preference in regards to story, structure, etc. But to me Odyssey felt like quantity over quality where Shadows feels like kind of a mix (I won't say it's all quality for sure, and as always with AC games there's too much repetition in side activities). \n\nAll in all I'm loving Shadows. I'd rank it second to Origins in the new wave of AC. I would also rank Odyssey at the very bottom so it makes sense we'd have differing opinions on this haha. But to me Odyssey was a good Greek mythology fantasy game, which is all the things AC is not. It largely crapped on the lore and ruined Layla as a character, where Valhalla sort of managed to redeem her despite having a lot to fix.",

Create this big beautiful world but put absolutely nothing in to it to make us want to explore it. Somehow this is even worse in shadows than in Valhalla. I did think some of the side content in Valhalla was good, but in shadows it’s just boring. Also in Shadows, because there’s so much elevation change, you’re almost forced to stay on paths, actively preventing you from exploring. As a whole the world looks great, but there’s nothing memorable about it. Each region is the same. No real iconic locations or buildings that stand out.\n\nI think the story is pretty good it’s just not put together well. Ubisoft is just not good at telling these non linear stories. Valhalla and mirage were even worse than shadows here, but it’s still not good\n\nI do think the story in shadows is better than odyssey, and the characters are far more interesting. I prefer the darker tone of shadows to odyssey, which just kind of felt like the entire story was one big joke. I enjoy not having to travel around on a boat.. and got pretty tired of that after Rogue. The gameplay, in my opinion, blows odyssey out of the water.. which is really what puts them on equal footing for me",

Shadows is technically a better AC game, but by trying to cram open world RPG with old school AC (and using this Naoe / Yasuke mechanic to do it) just does not work.\n\nMy main issue is actually the story and imo both having dual protagonists and a non linear story made writing this game very difficult, and so it’s incredibly bland and does not bob, weave and connect back to prior beats like a great story should. Instead Shadows is broken into compartmentalised stories and each “story” has to be segmented with its own beginning and end. They were going for spaghetti western, written like a TV series but imo it ends up being very scattered, and unfulfilling.\n\nThe other issue, is the writing is one note. It’s so serious , so flat and so monotonous. These protagonists, I’m sorry, are not interesting characters.\n\nNow couple these story elements with how empty the world is in terms of variety, how the only way to traverse effectively is to follow roads and the ever groan inducing question mark filled map.\n\nWhat we end up with, is imo, just a very confused, neither here nor there, bland game that looks great but doesn’t do very much with this beautiful world.\n\nI’ve finished every AC, I even managed to finish Valhalla despite not liking it towards the middle to end point. But I think I’m probably going to drop Shadows at 30ish hours in. I wanted so badly for the game to be good, I wanted to love it, I want Ubisoft releasing great AC games.

Shadows I’ve also found excellent, but I do like the mythological flavor of odyssey more and how huge and expansive the world seems thanks to the individual islands and ocean travel. Also loved the dlcs Valhalla combat and gameplay I enjoy but I find the story itself too big and a lot of it is bland despite having some excellent characters as well as an interesting modern day storyline (which wasn’t followed up on). I have dawn do ragnarok but never got around to playing it because ironically enough the mythological stuff in Valhalla I found boring aside from its modern day implications. Origins I give credit to for starting the rpg formula and having a strong intro and main character. But I found its third act really disjointed and weak. Septimus/flavius it feels we barely get to know prior to their deaths and while given plot reasons to want them dead, I don’t feel like they get enough screen time u masked to really make an impact. Also Caesar is simultaneously underutilized and over utilized somehow.  Like he shows up and is sort of an ally but we don’t get enough development before he goes Templar and then just dips out then we jump ahead like months or years and he’s suddenly the final target of the game and is also apparently a big enough deal to the Templars manipulating him that he’s the “father of understanding”. They should have just made him the primary antagonist all game long or introduced him earlier in the plot. And I’m not even against having aya be the one taking him out, it just feels weird since the majority of the game we’ve played as bayek and they don’t even let us customize or upgrade aya.

I love fantasy RPGs over any genre so it really spoke to me. That and I love Greek Mythology. I love Japanese history as well but Shadow’s story is so slow and the map is a chore to traverse. Give me back my demigod powers any day so I can fly off mountain tops and slam down in the middle of a fort dive and subsequently fire 6 fire arrows into unsuspecting throats only to disappear a second later. So smooth, so fun. Shadows feels clunky in comparison. The skill tree is boring, animations get stale. I will say Shadows does have a more realistic and fine tuned stealth system and also of course more beautiful ray tracing graphics.

Yasuke has potential to be amazing but it falls flat.\n\n>But to me Odyssey was a good Greek mythology fantasy game, which is all the things AC is not.\n\nIncorrect. Assassin's Creed has always been fictional, science fictional, and has always involved spiritual stuff. Odyssey didn't even take this the furthest (Valhalla did).

I actually just started replaying it, since I after 70 hrs of Shadows needed a break. \n\n\nThe quests in Odyssey is also so much more varied. I hunt myrthical beasts, hunt animals, solve crimes, assassinate targets, fight mercenary bosses, look for stolen items, do treasure hunts, upgrade my ship and so on. In Shadows its 60 % assassinate targets and 30 % shrines and temples. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, the combat and world or Shadows is amazing and stealth is great.

                "body": "The side content in Shadows is easily the worst out of the RPG AC titles. Nearly every assassination board mission is barely a step above the randomized \"kill this target\" quests you get from the kakuregas, and they make up the bulk of the side quests. Nobutsuna's students and the yokai are the only outliers. Yokai because the premise is interesting, and Nobutsuna's students because the fights are actually somewhat unique.\n\n\nThere are barely any side quests with actual writing. Almost all of them are just ally recruitment quests, and there's maybe a dozen? Which is a ridiculously small number for an open world game.\n\n\nCastles all have the same objectives, just kill the samurai daisho and loot the chest, so after doing a few castles you realize that they play out pretty much the same every time.\n\n\nShrines, temples, katas, kuji-kiris, and horse archery are very mechanically simple. Hidden paths and kofun are somewhat engaging environmental puzzles.\n\n\nEven ignoring the side content, the main story content isn't even that engaging. None of the bosses feel really unique (except maybe two, the two-faced and the one at the end of Naoe's story).\n\n\nThe story is a bit more subjective, but I feel like Naoe's story was a pretty uninspired revenge plot (and I usually love revenge plots). Her interactions with most of the shinbakufu feel disconnected and dispassionate. After you kill the first three, she barely seems invested in her own storyline. The writing at the end of her journey is laughably bad, it turns out that >!her mother's favorite song is the key to opening the place where the treasures are kept, and Hanzo's revealed motivations are unbelievably childish.!< The individual targets get barely any screentime, I was never surprised by any of their identities, and Naoe barely seems to care about any of them after the golden teppo and the one-eared.\n\n\nYasuke's story feels disjointed because of its nonlinear presentation. It introduces plot points and expects us to immediately care about them, instead of introducing plot points early on, letting them marinate, then having a big payoff later. Yasuke's whole storyline, especially his rise from slave to student to samurai could've been way more interesting if it was given more development, but they fumbled it.\n\n\nI like the itemization. There wasn't really any reason to use a mixed gear set in Valhalla and Odyssey (unless you were using purples in Odyssey) so I like that they reduced armor down to just head and body armor. Each legendary piece has a unique effect, and you can put together some cool combos. My only complaint is that legendary items are just retextures of other gear, rather than having unique models.\n\n\nThe main things I think the game does well are the stealth (easily second best out of the whole series, right behind Unity), the seasons (an insane amount of work must've been put in for it to work), and the dual protagonist system (although Yasuke feels a bit like an afterthought) but the meat of the game is so bland that I feel like Shadows will be remembered as one of the weaker entries in the series.",

They still think it‘s a great game, I can’t wait for them to realize how bare bones and boring Shadows is in comparison to Origins and Odyssey. Compared to them it’s simply not a good open world game, it‘s rather bland and uninspired. I find it pretty funny how much people are gaslighting themselves when they say this is the best Assassin‘s Creed open world game.",

I really want to enjoy it, but I just want to play something else.\n\nI think a big part of that though, is that I'm kind of burnt out on these massive open world games. Don't even want to play Horizon right now, so I picked up some smaller titles to play through. I thought I just wasn't in the mood for open world games, but really I'm just tired of modern open world design. A lot of these games are trying to appeal to every group, and suffer because of it. You can do stealth! Action! Crafting! Base-building! Extensive and complicated perk trees! They try to do too much at once, and it shows in my opinion. I choose a specific game because it has something unique that I enjoy — but lately it seems most of these open world games just try to one-up each other in terms of size and systems. They're really all just doing the same thing, with flavor differences. I've been trying to play more unique games lately.",

Something that may have not been intended though is that assassins mostly play like ninja, with their tools, methodical stealth and effective combat, so it's a welcome surprise(?) when shadows actually feels like you're an assassin. Obviously it's due to their emphasis on ninja gameplay.\n\nAmong other things, because in my opinion the rpg elements in shadows, specifically the legendary perks are much better elements for role playing (including restricted slots for engraving - which also indirectly involves the small amount of gear slots) that tge general, and really easy to pull off \"+20% critical chance\" that you can slot 5 times and now you're OP but not really role playing, because you're playing the exact same way, only now you're stronger. I'm aware that shadows retains these easy stats in its formula when i say this, but the inclusion and amount of actual gameplay changing stats is a welcome one that should be in more rpg lite games of this sort.",

I don't think that skill trees make a game inherently better. I said something recently on another post, but I don't think that AC benefits from RPG mechanics very much. The only reason Ubisoft pivoted to that was to chase the trend of open-world RPGs in an effort to increase sales. And it worked! It totally worked, but AC has lost its identity along the way. It's now massive open-world RPG #432 with much-diminished parkour and alt-historical flavorings. I don't think that Shadows is a return to form at all, really. They upgraded the stealth mechanics, yes, but light detection wasn't in any of the classic AC games. That was never the point of those games. So really, Shadows has as much in common with classic AC as the rest of the RPGs.\n\nI'm not hating here either. I'm not emotionally invested in the failure of Ubisoft or anything like some folks, I WANT them to succeed as a company, but I'm now realizing that that might mean they make games different from what I usually enjoy and THAT'S OKAY. Ubisoft has given me my favorite games of all time, and nothing will affect the joy that I've gotten from so many of their games over the years. Hell, AC 2, Far Cry 2, and Splinter Cell shaped my taste in games, and defined my childhood and much of my adolescence as well. I LOVE Ubisoft; I will be forever grateful, and nothing will ever change that — even if they don't make games for me anymore.\n\n\nSorry, I didn't mean to write that much but I'm passionate about these things because they are so dear to me. I'm not giving up on Shadows or Ubisoft. Shadows is devastatingly beautiful, so I'll continue chipping away at it and at the very least, I'll explore the whole map. Maybe they'll release that Museum mode for it eventually! That would be so fucking awesome. And I'll always be excited for a new Ubisoft release — even if I don't play it — because they've had a huge impact on my life through their games.",

So no trying to debate the merits of the game itself.\n\nI'm curious what others think of DLSS 4 MFG. After playing with the settings, I've settled on max in game settings, max ray tracing, DLAA and 4x FG at 4K. I played for an hour last light with those settings and was absolutely impressed how well it looked and performed. \n\nI was wondering is it just me because this is the first time 4x FG has worked well in the games I've tried it. A little shimmering around hair if I look hard enough but that's it. And no noticeable latency. With these settings it's going around 170 FPS and it's silky smooth.\n\nIs that what others are seeing?

All the characters seem like they're stuck with the writing of pre 2013 standards like I genuinely feel like I would like this shit if I was 15 again and I'm 27. I love the worlds they recreate and have many good memories but I along with many other people have grown past Ubisoft, they put in very little effort and where they do put effort it's not in gameplay it's in shit they didn't need to focus on. \n\nAt least in my opinion I played far cry 5 and beat it and it was one of the most boring games I've ever played and I've heard the same things with outlaws, Valhalla, far cry 5 and everything else.

Tent pole franchises of entire genres like AC (if one can count \"stealth based action rpg\" as a unique subgenre) should be innovating and pushing the genre forward, a good example of this is souls games where each one is a clear and definitive improvement on the last in *almost* everyday. \n\nThis just looks like a game i already played in 2018, but worse",

The issue I have is that Ubisoft says they can choose the character for each individual mission/ side quest, which knowing them will lead to some awful animation mistakes and bugs. A lot of people have an issue with the protagonists of the game, but they don't bother me that much TBH. I think that they look pretty boring, but I've played with worse and had lot's of fun.\n\nSeriously though, if this game doesn't work out for them, I think it's game over for Ubisoft. They've had so many failures recently that they seriously need a big break, or the company may go bankrupt or be bought - and honestly, I like the sound of a new company taking the reigns of the AC series.",

But you will have to be forgiving and understand just how old these games are 😅😂\n\n\nIt was definitely quite an experience when it came out, and Ezio will probably go down in gaming history as one of the most beloved protagonists ever.\n\n\nIf it doesn't work out, or if you feel you might not ever get to it, watch a playthrough on youtube. There are also cutscene montages for each game with most of the great moments.\n\n\nCheers.",

Its pathetic and theres a pattern following these games that keep failing.

Everyone else is crazy homie you're living in the truth that professor totally isn't under investigation. \n\nIn the Kurima family document (P00101) No. 1 ‘Letter of Kiyomasa Kato, year unknown’ (addressed to Matazaemon Shimokawa and others), the word ‘Kuroho’ appears in a description related to Hideyoshi Toyotomi’s invasion of Korea. In “Black Samurai: Yasuke, the African Samurai Who Served Nobunaga” broadcast on NHK BS4K on March 30, 2021, Thomas Lockley, Associate Professor of Nihon University, stated that the ‘Kuroho’ mentioned in this document may be the successor of Yasuke, a black samurai who served Oda Nobunaga. The document is a ‘Kuroho’ document.”\n\n  \nThey continued, “First of all, we at the archives have not recognized this ‘Kuroho’ as a black person at all, and we are surprised by Mr. Lockley’s suggestion. In fact, whether or not this ‘Kuroho’ was Yasuke, there had been a view that he was presumed to be black (Nakajima Rakuaki, “16th Century Late Kyushu – Southeast Asia Trade,” Shigaku Zasshi, No. 118-8, etc.). At this point, however, it is difficult to make a definite determination, since the blacks appear in only one place in this document. For example, the word ‘kuroho’ also appears in ‘The Tale of Genji,’ which means ‘kuroho’ (kneaded incense) and seems to occur frequently in Japanese classics.”\n\n“In addition, some our staff members have suggested that it would be more natural to see it as a description of an object, rather than a person, when reading our documents. Based on the above, it is the opinion of the archives staff of the museum that it is difficult to immediately conclude that “kuroho” is a black person at this point in time,” it concluded.\n\n[https://www.pref.gunma.jp/site/monjyokan/130144.html](https://www.pref.gunma.jp/site/monjyokan/130144.html)",

Your tools also have a lot of ways to customize how they work to your playstyle. Armored enemies can only be damaged from behind so I upgraded my throwing knifes to pierce armor to help with those tough enemies.

I, and anyone interested in actually seeing how Ubisoft is performing can get quite a decent indication at how Ubisoft’s financial situation is looking. \n\nSales are stagnating, Ubisoft has spent the past years blowing through money and they have absolutely nothing to show for it as people increasingly step away from their franchises due to a lack of love being put into development. \n\nMy intention is not to hate on the people making these games, I’m sure a lot of them are great people.

Samurai didn’t see honour in face to face combat, they saw it in victory, they would unironically do what the ghost does without losing “honor”.\n\nAs for your next points, wrong again. You can’t compare GTA, a series that is constantly being updated and kept in look with online and mods+remasters to a game that was put out, and left. As for the test copies, you are proving my point. People got the game early and got to test it and then realized it was dog shit, not beforehand. No one was shitting on veilgard until those test copies were reviewed so the fact that you sit here and claim a game without any test reviews is automatically shit is hilarious.\n\nSpeaking of Thomas, who the hell cares what he did. I’m CERTAIN the multibillion dollar organization with full time staff dedicated to research didn’t use Wikipedia for their fuckin arguments. They took a vague figure with almost no history and shaped him into a samurai. This just happened to be what some moronic tool editing Wikipedia argued. They didn’t use Thomas as their source. 😂😂\n\nAC games aren’t my favourite, I mean I enjoy them but I love games such as RDR2 and GoT wayyy more, I can’t wait for GoY. The AC games are ok, lately they been pretty bloated but mirage was a nice addition.",

Figured I would share it since I haven't seen it anywhere yet.\n\n**Click the link and save a copy. This will let you start making changes to the document for your hideout.**\n\nRight now, only the Tea Room, Forge, and Dojo are listed as Non-Connectable Rooms in the game, so I put them down lower on the Buildings tab to separate them from the Connectable Rooms.\n\nCurrent problems with this:\n\n1. No decoration pieces or Engawa. You will have to add those manually.\n2. I haven't figured out how to label how the buildings attach to one another. The Connectable Rooms can only attach to each other in specific orientations. I haven't tried to establish the pattern yet. It might be as simple as designating certain buildings as North/South facing and East/West facing.\n\nLet me know if you see any mistakes! I might make updates to this if there's enough demand.",

I’m going full stealth and I’ve been using basically the same legendary armor since the beginning because the game keeps giving me trash with bad passives—same with the weapons. They just pile up in my inventory and I don’t even look at them. It’s all boring adrenaline passives I don’t even use because I’m playing on the hardest difficulty and the skills are so overpowered I barely use them anyway.\n\nAre all the shops and vendors the same?\n\nIn The Witcher or Odyssey, if you explored you actually looted cool stuff. Here, half the time I try to cut through mountains, get lost, and find nothing…\n\nThe operations base is kind of interesting, and even though I’m not much into crafting, it’s not bad—you can make it look really nice. But I’ve already upgraded all the buildings to the max. I never go into them though—why would I? Half of them don’t really contribute anything. Now I just have way too many scouts all the time.\n\nI’ve put in 40–50 hours but it felt really forced, and the worst part is that I went back to replay historical time periods with Unity, Origins… I needed to get away from Shadows. Funny enough, Valhalla—which people criticize a lot—I actually liked, and it motivated me way more at the beginning. There was more skill complexity (everyone complains about the skills in Valhalla), but I liked being able to fully customize my stats. The gear and characters were way better in Valhalla.\n\nPoor Ubisoft—it’s a great and unique company. Sometimes it feels like they don’t know which part of the audience to please, and in the end they please no one.\n\nWhen it comes to looting, they always give you the same stuff—I don’t even feel like opening chests anymore.\n\nIt’s either the same materials or weapons with worse passives than what I already have.\n\nMost of the cities are ugly, and I don’t feel immersed in their atmosphere. There are some distinctive places, but half the cities look alike.\n\nI could go on all day listing negative things about Shadows.\n\n\n",

It also doesnt help that theres about thousand barred and locked doors too many in Valhalla just to get some borring piece of gear that I personally didnt find reason to use. Skills and gear too in Valhalla felt like it didnt do much difference for me and skill tree really was insane in Valhalla but it was basically a couple of good and meaningfull things among million +1% damage bonus and you were forced to upgrade 3 or 4 things you didnt needed to get to a upgrade you really want. I felt that parkour and combat was better than odysseys climb everything in a most basic way and combat where 10 mercenarys would gang up on you along with half a village and 10 chickens and bombs and arrows would be flying like its Christmass while the mercenarys would sprint like Usain Bolt and jumping at you like they are on springs.

But I was talking to a friend while adjusting settings and such for AC Shadows and my poor 3070 can only do about 30ish fps stably. \n\nWhen I said I was fine with that my friend actually gasped. It was like I said I murdered the dog. Maybe it’s because I spent most of my gaming life on a console but I really don’t mind 30 fps. For me the annoyance and issues come from a game bouncing around between high highs and low lows. I’d much rather have a stable 30 than bounce between 50 and 20. \n\nEdit: I really had no idea this was such a hot button topic when I posted it. Damn. \n\nFor the record I have played games in 60fps before either on a higher end console or on my Pc and while I can tell the difference it’s not really a deal breaker for me. Like I said in my post I’d rather have a game be stable around 30 than bouncing around and stutter like crazy. \n\nI also plan to replace my 3070 soon since it is a bottleneck in my build but for obvious reasons that’s not happening any time soon and I’m too excited for this game to wait. \n\nSecond update: before work I decided to try a few things and now it’s magically hit 68 fps avg. I don’t know what FRS is but it’s magic. ",

I'm just sharing my perspective.\n\nTo be clear, at no point am I talking about any form of frame gen.\n\nThe human eye can't pick out the detail from a specific frame at 360fps, but what the human eye ***is*** very good at is seeing *change* at high speed.\n\nIt's a double edged sword. It's why an unstable 60fps that's more like 50-20 looks like complete trash (because you're seeing tons of hitching change that shouldn't be there). But it's also why a 360 fps locked feels suuuuper crisp and snappy, and your eyes, depending on the kind of game, are getting *significantly* more information about what's going on (skill effects drawing 5 additional frames at 360fps for every one frame at 60fps) can be enormously beneficial.\n\nThere's also the aspect of when frames are rendered much faster, your game inputs are rendered on screen precisely that much faster. It *FEELS* immensely more responsive. 30fps feels like there's a loose rubber band between my mouse and my turns on screen.\n\nTbh, personally I was genuinely surprised at how helpful it was to go from 60hz to 144hz back in 2013.\n\nUpgrading from that same old blurry 144hz to a crisp 360hz QD-OLED last year has been without question, the most extraordinary upgrade for my time playing games.\n\nCaveats to this: I run almost everything on my steam deck at 40fps unless it's something in streaming from the desktop directly to the deck\n\nI'm a long time gamer with a distinctly competitive slant, though I certainly enjoy solo games too, and those I make more pretty. If it's a competitive multiplayer game, I'm one of those that cranks the settings waaaaay down. Remove foliage clutter, simplify textures, turn all that shit off - anything that benefits seeing a target - and crank the fps to the moon.\n\nTbh don't even like my desktop at 60hz.

I mean I've been slowly lowering what feels smooth to me ever since I got my steam deck which runs things at 30-60fps. Nowadays anything over \\~90fps feels smooth.  \nHonestly if anything higher refresh rate isn't worth it. It means much higher requirements just to get a frame rate that feels smooth to you.

Too offset this problem, resources normally handled by the GPU card are dumped to the CPU and desktop RAM which is clocked much much slower. Everytime that happens, you'll get stuttering. For example, For Honor which came out years ago now, was bottle necking the VRAM on 3070ti's back then. They only have 8gigs.. What are the timing specs on your desktop RAM? These specs are just as important vs how much desktop RAM you have on gaming PCs now. Never used to be 15+ years ago, but here we are.\n\n\nThis issue is very very noticable in FF7Rebirth on PC and MH Wilds right now. So much so that there are several mods specifically made to fix this because the developers couldn't be bothered to yet.\n\n\nAre textures popping? Lower your graphics settings. \nAlso, how high do you have the graphics settings? Maxed?\nTry lowering them. \n\n\nWhat monitor do you have? A standard 1080 60hz monitor with your setup should run this fine at a stable 60fps. A 48\" Ultra Wide 5k 240hz monitor? It's going to run like shit.

FFVII Rebirth for example was too big a compromise for a lot of people to get to 60 fps on PS5, but for me there wasn't even a question that performance mode is clearly the way to go, even if it resulted in a soft image.",

If you have VRR you can make a lot of framerates look good but if you have a regular monitor or tv then anything that's not a locked 30 or 60 will look bad. The quality of something like motion blur is also important. Good motion blur can really save 30 fps games.

The server was capped at 30 fps.\n\n60 fps definitely looks smoother in fast-paced games, but it can also look shitty in more cinematic contexts.",

It's an eyesore never liked it. 60fps is bare miminum but doesn't even feel ideal. Somewhere around 90fps it starts looking and feeling smooth. 144fps+ is just great. This of course matters most with a high refresh screen and VRR. And to the FPS try-hards that run uncapped and jump from 100-200fps all day I would say just limit your fps to around the average PC will run cooler/less power and feel just as good.",

It's probably a smooth 30fps because your GPU and CPU are both taking a nap and can handle it easily.\n\nThat's not even close to reasonable for that card on that game. You should backup all your files n pictures n stuff and do a fresh windows install with fresh everything. Not even worth troubleshooting that just start fresh. Then have your friend help you with your in-game settings. If you're just hitting play and playing games, you really should just get a console instead of getting a new GPU. It's a huge waste of money if you're not going to get the most out of your PC especially how prevalent cross-play is now.\n\nThere's a level of care that needs to be taken or you're just screwing yourself over.",

Some games it doesn't matter as much with turn based RPGs and whatever (FFVII ran at 15fps in battle, but the menus were 60) but for faster paced games like shooters or action games? Higher is always better, even if it means dropping settings.\n\nEdit: Baffled that I'm getting downvoted for saying the above. 30fps is the bare minimum of playability being acceptable. Or are folks ok with 20fps or less? That's still a good experience?\n\nAge of Calamity could hit as low as single digits, it was an awfully performing game. I can't imagine many that would play that and not want it to run better than it did. I sold it because it ran so bad it just wasn't a good experience.\n\nThis is somehow controversial opinions? Somehow if the framerate is higher it's not an objectively better experience?  Like take whatever game you're playing now and the dev got it to run at 60, 90 or 100 fps  with no downside and someone is going to actually say that's worse?\n\nBeing ok and playing 30fps? Sure. Been there too. Especially when you're on console or heck- a budget. It's fine. But saying it's good/better than higher framerates? No. \n\nI do not understand folks on reddit.

Under 5 was where I'd draw the line, and only view the slideshow for its \"high-resolution\" beauty.\n\n30 was great to hit. For a long time people were content with the 30-60fps range. You'd crank your settings enough to get highs in the 45-80fps range, with plenty of dips down to around 30, and that was fine. Switching to \"32-bit\" color was worthwhile for the dip into that range.\n\n30 WAS indeed \"fine\" - even better if there's some motion blur (or crt phosphor persistence) in there to smooth things out. I think 30 is more jarring with today's display tech, and especially with displays that update pixels much faster.

What you are **failing to account for is JUDDER** across long pans / tilts / rotations. A higher frame rate allows for more images across the same arc which appears more smooth. For example if a camera rotates 90° over 1 second then the camera will cover these degrees for these FPS:\n\n| FPS | Degrees/frame |\n|:--|:--|\n| 30 | 3° / frame |\n| 60 | 1.5° / frame |\n| 120 | 0.75° / frame |\n\nI am a professional game developer and graphics programmer and there is ZERO excuse for 30 FPS in 2025 -- **only excuses by incompetents/lazy programmers.** For me the proof that 60 FPS was FAR superior to a crappy 30 FPS was when I worked on _Need For Speed (PS1)_ and we had a _Daytona USA_ arcade machine. The PSX / PS1 was limited to 30 FPS but _Daytona_ running at 60 FPS was SO smooth.\n\nJust because YOU can’t tell the difference between 30 / 60 / 120 FPS does NOT imply it is not important for _others._\n\n3\\. **GOOD VR** requires **a MINIMUM of 90 FPS** if you don’t want to make people sick.\n\n4\\. **Input lag** is a real thing. It is NOT JUST drummers who can be sensitive to even 1 ms. Thirteen years ago for touch input [Microsoft demonstrated 1ms input lag](https://youtu.be/vOvQCPLkPt4) is MUCH more responsive. iOS devices run at 120 FPS because Apple recognizes this provides a smoother experience than a choppy 30 FPS.\n\nSo enjoy your games in 30 FPS; the **rest of us** will enjoy 60, 120, or even 240 FPS for display and input lag.",

I can play a game at 120fps and have fun, I can also play a game at 30 and have fun. It’s fine, let me enjoy it.

But I have to go through all these disconnected targets to do so. I don't believe that these characters should remain emotionally the same throughout, some scenes feel heavy and important to thier respective character but it isn't followed through in the following questline. \nValhalla had this problem but I believe this trend started with Odyssey. But Odyssey narratively justified this with Kassandras characterization and set up. This isn't the case with Shadows and Valhalla. These stories have personal stakes that the audiences want to see through. Both Valhalla and especially Shadows had phenomenal openings that really hook you, but the bulk of the game doesn't follow suit. Unity had this issue too. I was hooked then the game turned into a hitlist. \nI would suggest either shortening the games or better yet get rid of this \"choose where to go\" set up.

This game could be given significant gates that have to be passed to enable further progression without in anyway changing the open world. Both Naoe and Yasuke's personal boards show this can be done, so it should be possible to scale it up. Maybe Ubisoft don't even see the problem. I hope it's not that their code's state handling is so fragile that it couldn't cope.\n\nIt's a shame, because the opening story and the Naoe/Yasuke personal boards have some great storytelling in them.

That way after you completed a zone you are forced to check in with the main plot and keep the connection with the characters and it gives the story more urgency. It is also better for curiosity if you can't explorer the whole map and basically 'seen' everything the first hours of playing. With main story gated checkpoints you don't know what is coming and the game, world and side content and can keep surprising you. Ghost Of Tsushima, God Of War and The Witcher 3 are good examples of this approach. Horizon Forbidden West did this also where you have 4 story gates.\n\nAnother way is letting people explore the whole world map, but changing the world and adding stuff to it when you play the main story. This is the approach from the Spiderman games and also works pretty well. You start with only main missions and after completing main story missions that keep adding sidestuff and change up the whole map while the story is progressing. This keeps things fresh as well.\n\nI hope Ubisoft learns from this because all their games have this issue. Outlaws, Avatar, FarCry also suffer from their approach. The first 15 hours start out glorious with a sense of wonder and progression. But after a while it can get pretty monotous.",

With this option turned on, similar to the skills for assassinating that add more health chunks, the skills for kunai damage have the “Guaranteed Assassination option is active” message at the bottom.\n\nThis tells me that kunai throws should be treated the same as assassinations, for enemies with no head armor, right?\n\nI’ve noticed that enemies with 3 health bars, my headshot kunai will only remove two of the three bars. Even more strange, when I go to my inventory and select the kunai, it shows “Health Segments Removed = 1,” even though I have one perk that gives me an additional health segment removal for kunai throws.\n\nI’m just so confused as to how kunai are supposed to operate. The disclaimer on the kunai perks make it seem like they are similar to guaranteed assassinations, but I’m seeing different behavior in game.",

Maybe by adding insta-fail insufferable tailing missions OG fans used to hate too lol. I think alot of the dislike came from the fact that some of the more extreme OG fans didn't wanna admit that it did feature all the core pre-RPG mechanics and that didn't magically deliver the best thing ever alone.\n\n\nMirage is decent, but it also exposes how overblown some of the complaints from OG fans were. Once stealth, assassinating and all the recycled iconography was back in , it showed pretty well that older games depended extremly heavily on tight writing and other aspects (pirate fantasy in Black Flag, casanova fantasy in AC2) to carry them through. Certinately not on any complex platforming, great combat or stealth on the level of Splinter Cell or Hitman.\n\n\nI could give Unity/Syndicate fans more credit as these 2 games actually tried to push stealth and parkouring into a BIT more complex territory. But prior to that AC was really simplistic in every aspect, carried through by writing and kitchen mix of features that sometimes worked better, sometimss worse.",

Also, Ac 2 is not really a casanova fantasy? Like, that's a genuinely weird way to describe what people liked about Ac 2. The fact we occasionally flirt with women, and one sex scene at the beginning is hardly casanova territory.\n\nI personally think majority of people liked Ac 2 because we got to play as a skilled assassin, wearing cool hooded robes, parkouring across the cities in renaissance Italy, and getting to stab the bad guys while trying to be discreet in doing so.",

I'm more of the meta maniac anyway. If something says it'll proc by using a certain way of attacking, I have to try it to see how viable it is. The bleed on entanglement is pretty brutal when that skill is maxed out. Deflect to bleed is hilarious when combined with tool bleeds stacked by vault shurikens, and then a back attack weakpoint strike ends the sequence.\n\n\nAs far as inflating stats go, I usually just don't bother if there is something synergistic to the way I play instead. I feel like the real game is in combat synergy anyway. So far base stats don't do much outside the gear statistics and passives from mastery",

        "text": "I am deut type colourblind, reds mostly. Everything in AC is shades of red and orange, which means I often can't see, or can't tell the difference between attack telegraphing. i.e. on red sand background I can't see the lethal attack prompt at all, other times I can't tell the difference between white and orange attack prompts.\n\n~~I searched the options for colour customisation, I would love to make the prompts purple and light blue, which I can see easily and shouldn't blend with 90% of the game background, but I can't find anything, does it exist and I am I looking in the wrong place?~~\n\n~~To work around this, I have increased my Nvidia colour setting: \"Digital Vibrance\" to 80%, I am using windows colourblind mode for deuteranopia and I am using a Geforce experience colour-blindness filter at 100% intensity for deuteranopia. Unfortunately i am still finding it difficult to see the difference between the lethal attack prompts and the background, the shades are just too similar. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe shift the hue slightly with Nvidia? I haven't tried that yet.~~\n\nI have played around with the settings a bunch and find the following settings work best for me:\n\nWindows Colourblind mode: Deuteranopia\n\nNvidia Digital Vibrance on monitor 80%\n\nNvidia game filters:\n\nSharpen+  \n\\- Intensity: 87%  \n\\- Texture Details: 66%\n\nBrightness/Contrast  \n\\- Exposure: -46%  \n\\- Contrast: 100%  \n\\- Highlights: 100%  \n\\- Shadows: 100%  \n\\-Gamma: 0%\n\nBare in mind colour-blindness is quite specific and you may need a variation of these settings to be able to see the prompts clearly.\n\nI find the worst is in the battles, whent red particle physx are in the air, the only option I have found to survive this scenario is to change the hue in Nvidia, to -240%, making all the reds blue, it is still really hard to distinguish, and far from realistic, but it makes it playable fo rme and I managed to complete these battles in that setting, Make sure to turn off all colour blind filters if using that option though, or there will be no colour graduation at all.\n\nIt also highlights just how much red palette is used in this game, it is REALLY red.\n\nStill interested in any official support available.",

So just raw GPU goodness exceeding not only my expectations, but most of the gaming competition (at launch)\n\nSo yeah, this is just an appreciation post  \nThx devs!

As if no one could've spotted Ezio in a crowd of completely differently dressed Ottomans. I really wish they'd give us social stealth for akin to something like Hitman, and even add dialog to that so that if someone suspects us despite our disguise, we can still talk our way out of it and then continue to make our way to our target without killing anyone - as any assassin who follows the creed should.",

The game still looks insanely good to me (plus I’m also playing off a 1080p TV, so there’s that limitation too), and performs well too. I can’t see any real reason it couldn’t support as many hideout assets as the other platforms do — especially given it’s secluded from the open-world via a loading screen.\n\nSo, I quickly checked the animal limit while I was building, just now. Like I said, I might’ve been mistaken because I wasn’t counting the animals I had when I hit the limit before, and good thing I did. I was wrong. It *is* 30 on X-S. That’s on me, it really did feel like I was nowhere near 30.\n\nAs for the cat island. I’ve been there. Can’t say what it’s like on other platforms, but there are a lot of cats there.",

I am pretty sure this is the only time I've had both options available throughout the entire game, so it is definitely not a common occurrence.\n\nI did a little experimenting and the Assassinate action triggers as soon as you press the A button, even if you don't let go.

The majority of the game has to be written in a way where it can happen in any sequence and make sense, so like the Omi main target missions have no real bearing on the Harima missions, etc. And in a character driven game, that hurts their development.\n\nYasuke and Naoe's friendship goes from nonexistent/tense to close friends in basically two cutscenes, and we don't get to really see how they get there because the game can't do that. Most of their development is in their individual character side arcs, which in a more linear game would be integrated better into the main story.",

The world is beautiful but something about it is missing. It's like here's a path, follow it, or else get stuck being blinded by dense endless mountainous bushland.\n\nI'm finding it really disruptive to the flow of the game, and there's not enough interesting interactivity or exploration between towns to make it feel like anything other than a slog; a beautiful slog, but not even the visuals can keep me attentive through it.\n\nI actually can't pinpoint exactly what it is that feels lacking, as I loved Origins and Odyssey's vast open worlds, but with Valhalla and now Shadows I think Ubisoft has become too indulgent in its own cliches for my tastes.\n\n\nAt this point, as a working adult with a full-time job and other commitments, I think the RPG elements and time-sink nature of these recent bloated AC games are just not for me. Running across rooftops in dense urban zones felt amazing, in older ACs or even Mirage.

But it used to be in a set order so that there would be a narrative through line from one to the next. The protagonist could learn and improve as the game went on, and the antagonist would react to your actions. \n\nNow you get no development in the middle of the story, and antagonists will never acknowledge that potentially all their other allies have recently been killed.  \n\nUbisoft have become way to reliant on this structure in my opinion.

The most important of these properties are the presence of character arcs, gradual development of relationships, thematic continuation, set up and pay off. When you know in what order your players will experience the journey, you can deliver a logical flow in the narrative and build up something complex and *emotional*. In the non-linear games, the writers are forced to come up with completely disjointed scenarios that should make sense to you no matter in what order you experience them. This robs the narrative of any potential for interesting character development or emotional story arcs, and it all plays out without any significant consequences or impact to the rest of the story. If you think back to Origins and Odyssey, for example, the most memorable moments for most people are the fates of the two little girls, because these are two of the very few times when the game does follow up one quest by building upon the character interactions and emotions established previously, rather than just present you with a new random scenario or a new random character to be discarded in 5 minutes. \n\nBut basically TLDR: I remember entire passages of dialogue from Revelations and I played that last more than 10 years ago. I remember exactly two missions from Odyssey and I finished that a few months ago. A linear narrative with character arcs and room for emotional buildup will always triumph over a series of disjointed \"quests\".",

Even an Aztec one would come out like this game, one big city with a bunch of jungle in between. People just want a bunch of different settings without realizing what they might actually be like in the real world.\n\nThe RPG style allows Ubisoft to do more settings because they aren’t limited to a densely urban city map. Origins was a big risk with how open it is and most people love it, Shadows is no more open than that, it’s really a lot more urbanized. Mirage tried to bring it back to one big city with some map around it and a lot people complained about it being too small. Nobody is ever happy with an AC game until 10 years after its release.",

Old fans don't have to worry since ubisoft would include things like instant assassination as an option anyway 😂\n\nOld AC combat felt like drunken hema choreography dance... so i definitely i disagree with fans saying that the old one has better combat... Maybe some elements are better but overall it has shown its age. \n\nHowever, main AC china (three kingdoms period) in the future would be amazing to see and I'm definitely hopeful with the future of AC as a franchise... It would be amazing to see Chinese martial arts including Qinggong (lightness techniques) on that future AC game.\n\nIt'll definitely be disappointing if they didn't make it an open world rpg game with how massive three kingdoms is.",

Back when I played AC Revelations as a kid, there was this corner of the map that had this Janissary camp and this building that had like 6 guard patrols protecting it in really close proximity to each other. It was great if you wanted a lot of guards to fight and I'd always head over there whenever I wanted to do some combat. It was right next to a fast travel station too so you could have them respawn really quickly.\n\nI revisited the game recently, went straight there (I still remembered that it was the first location on the fast travel map) and I very quickly realized that this building I was talking about where I'd routinely go to murder a bunch of guards is [a very real mosque.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatih_Mosque,_Istanbul)\n\nI didn't know any better as a kid. I never read any of the database entries or paid attention to the stuff on screen, so I'd just show up here on a regular basis with my battle axe and leave 24 corpses in the courtyard of this mosque. Pretty fucked up looking back on it now.\n\nNow, I don't mean to invalidate Japan's concerns about shrine destruction with this comment. Their culture is very different, and I'm sure the last thing they want is more dipshit foreigners like Logan Paul and Johnny Somali disrespecting historic landmarks.",

In many of the games in this series, there is a clear intentionality within the narratives and the world building, to tackle a difficult moral philosophical dilemma: is it better to have peace at the cost of our freedom taken away, or to have freedom at the cost of falling into disorder and chaos. The Templars exemplify the first moral standpoint, while the assassins stand behind the latter one. Many of the games, starting with the very first one, intentionally bring this question up as a legitimate question, meaning one with no clear immediate answer. Of course, the answer you go with is always contextual. And that’s what the different setting in the many ac games allow us to look at. Of course, since we play as assassins in almost every game, it’s easy to assume that assassins are always morally good and correct in their choices, intentions, ambitions. I think there’s a legitimate case to be made that one of the most consistent narrative aspects of the games is the parallel between Templars and assassins, how their moralities and their means can be seen as two sides of the same coin.",

Not saying I’m exactly right here history is always changing as we uncover and learn more but I didn’t feel the same way about origins despite the narrative being fictional.",

The FSB took it seriously: a year after the detention in Kansk, the head of the special service Alexander Bortnikov said that terrorists use virtual games to create “game situations of terrorist attacks”.\n\n>From the chats, law enforcement officers found out that schoolchildren were also engaged in pyrotechnic experiments - this is how articles about explosives appeared in the case. According to OVD-Info in the support group of “Kan teenagers”, there are only three episodes related to pyrotechnics in the case. The security forces also believe that the teenagers were preparing to blow up the buildings of law enforcement agencies in Kansk: the final wording of the accusation indicates that they were trained to commit acts of terrorism.\n\nTwo of the boys, Denis Mikhailenko and Bogdan Andreyev, confessed to the charges and were released under house arrest. It also came out that they were fashioning improvised smoke bombs and Molotov cocktails in their backyards.\n\nTaken in isolation, these individual events (government dissident on social media, and “science experiments”) don’t breach any laws; however, when you draw a connective thread between them, you can see why the authorities had reason to suspect the beginnings of a terrorist cell.\n\nWhat I absolutely will condemn them for is the illegal confinement of Nikita Uvarov in the pretrial phase.",

That this is not going to be a good game.\n\nPut aside the weird controversy and the very obvious attempt at being socially relevant by having us play a real life historical character for the first time ever in the series who also just so happens to be the only black samurai in existence  (I love Yasuke and his lore so don’t get it twisted, I just don’t trust Ubisoft to do a good job with him and I know pandering when I see it which is also kind of crazy cause it’s the 5th main game in a row where they won’t commit to just having a female protagonist by themselves, and no I’m not counting mirage because let’s be real that was just a glorified DLC).\n\nPutting aside that social controversy which in of itself is dumb on every side in every discussion, And look at just the game itself.\n\nThe first trailer that they put out which I wanna say was in the summertime for a November release in less than six months looked fucking terrible. Legitimately all of the gameplay trailers they put out did not look good and actually look to be at the same level if not worse than Valhalla during the PS five era.\n\nSo they delay it again to February, also Black History Month, right after the ghost of Yotei trailer dropped. I’m willing to **maybe** believe that that was a coincidence in an argument but on a personal level I don’t. \n\nAnyways now we’re getting all these new release gameplay trailers and they look better but they don’t look as good as they should for a game that’s been development this long and now they’re pushing back even further which tells me that there’s even more broken shit in this game that they haven’t fixed.\n\nAnd keep in mind people, at its highest price this was a $200 game and they were willing to release it with all of the bugs that they all of a sudden care about now to the general public with no issue. \n\nBut now that Ubisoft is on the brink of having to sell all of a sudden they give a shit about their games? It’s bullshit lol. \n\nI feel bad for the developers and the rank and file people because they’re just following orders but to the executives and the writers and the directors of these projects that are putting in the bare minimum? \n\nYou all better dust off those resumes and God help you Because I sure as shit hope you don’t get a job anywhere else. \n\nAnd the board of directors and the family that owns Ubisoft better get ready to sell.\n\nI know some people are saying “no we should let them take their time because we want this to be a good game” or “this could be the very last assassins Creed game we ever get so let’s wish them the best in making it great” and to that I say:\n\nThis series has been on its death bed since 2015 when unity came out, and I am old enough to remember what a shit show that was. They completely changed the games for the worse after syndicate and although origins had a fantastic story the gameplay sucked. Odyssey sucked as a whole although it might’ve been a good game on its own but it wasn’t an assassin Creed game, and Valhalla sucked a lot less but it again made the series into some weird RPG. And I’m not even gonna go into the whole DLC where you just played during Ragnarok as a literal God. And Mirage was just a glorified DLC that was attempting to nostalgia farm  what made the first assassin’s Creed so good. It literally added nothing to the series either from a story perspective or a gameplay perspective.\n\nEven if Ubisoft does end up selling whoever buys the company will probably just reboot the series or retool it which is fine because all the real fans have wanted for the past few years is just a black flag remake with updated graphics and maybe some extra weapons.\n\nBut at this point honestly, as someone who has been playing these games since the first one in 2009? I’m ready for the series to end. \n\nIt has really sucked over the past 10 years watching something that I really loved and looked forward to every year or every two or three being whored out into this unrecognizable mishmash of Poor gameplay, micro transactions, nonsense stories, completely forgettable characters and protagonists, and ideological talking points shoehorned into the game in ways that feel completely out of place and also so ridiculous in a series that was already designed to be culturally inclusive and diverse. \n\n“In order for something new to come,something old must go and that old can sometimes mean “let go of what you know until now”.\n\nEmpty the cup. And start from the beginning. It’s not easy to do but at the moment it’s the only way…. how something that is blocked to be brought back to movement.\n\nYou must spill the old tea. And pour a new one, then things look different.” \n\n-Shihengyi",

Show this man on the building running up and down, even if it's clunky cause of armor (im starting to think Yasuke in gear must feel awful on buildings as a way of Ubi forcing the player to want to always be on the ground as him. For the Odyssey crowd). With the original push-back feb date, seems like Ubi were going cut close to the wire not showing any slowdown parkour on his side. Hell, give us a whole mission start to finish of Naoe and Yasuke on a throw-away stronghold mission, something. Yasuke combat mechanically looks fine, but Naoe looks flashier and more fun for the assassin fantasy. The bts has to be a mess at the studio for prob many reasons.",

They would have to pit this game against a new monster hunter and the sequel to Kingdom come deliverance. Usually, AC games would outsell pretty much anything, but ubisoft shot their reputation in the head lately and alienated the fan base they built over the last 20 years. KCD became a new fan favourite and would probably sell better. \n\nI honestly think that is just Ubisoft delaying the inevitable.",

Now people say “it was too long and I got bored and quit”. They are never gonna make a game that everyone loves 100%. I liked odyssey above the others. Origins was good and I didn’t make it through an hour of mirage and haven’t played it again. But others love Mirage. As a gamer that started with Atari, I’ve watched gaming grow into what it is. I think the problem is… or some of it… they used to develop a game, sell it, and that was that. No input from us. And some good games were made in those times. Ninja gaiden, devil may cry, resident evil just to name a few. They either did good or bad. But now with YouTube reviews and social media, people can complain or make suggestions So they try to accommodate everyone to not get hate and it will just never happen. I remember a time where games were sometimes very offensive But it was a game and everyone knew maybe it’s just not for everyone. Now people can shut a company down and while that is good in some ways, it’s not in others. They may make a bad game, but if they shut down, there are no more games, period. If they don’t shut down, there are chances of good games in the future. Just my 2 cents nobody asked for. lol. I would like a good, complete game. But imo, if they are adding a month for consumer suggestions, it has potential to end up making the game worse because they had a vision, but altered that vision to satisfy someone else that has no real stake in the success of it. 🤷🏻‍♂️",

I couldn't get into the story of valhalla, there was nothing wrong with the gameplay. And again a gloomy kind of setting compared to the azure beaches of odyssey was also a huge contrast. But not getting into a story is not necessarily ubisoft's fault. But more my own subjective take on what i wanna see. \n\nMirage plays like a old fashioned stealth game. And it improved a couple of thing and the game looks great, nothing wrong with that. \n\nBut with shadows they made a big mistake to use a black guy as one of the protagonists. It's fine if something is historically incorrect all AC games are. But the problem is that all the games felt like a local character for that area. It doesn't feel forced that a kind of protagonist is used. I also found it a bit weird that the voices in unity had a complete posh english accent. While they could have gone with a subtle french accent. \nBut that was the use of just accent. \n\nNow, they have used a type of character that did or did not really exist ( That's another discussion i'm not having here) Gave him a race that was for the time being in japan very unlikely to be there. And even so, you expect that Ubisoft wanted to give one of the more local samurai a chance to shine. But no, they went with a black guy. It really is the odd one out of all the series. They totally went off the rails on this front. Add that up with the fact that the name: Assassin's Creed is very adapable with japan's samurai and ninja history. I can see the huge disappoinment people had.  Apart from that, i like how the game has it's own style.  But we'll see if it ever comes out. Haha",

I honestly think they just try to make shit shine, but in the end... it still smells of shit. \n\nA destroyed reputation by alienating the community they built over 20-30 years is not something you salvage and repair in a short time. People had enough of mediocrity, and this game WILL NOT SELL. Especially not when you keep delaying the game. Even the ones that have been looking forward to this game have a point where they will stop supporting it. The majority of people will not buy it simply because \"Ubishit\" made it, many will not buy it for the mistreatment of japanese heritage and culture, some will not buy it because they are racist and hate on blacks. And all this is coming from a once before, die-hard fan of the AC franchise.\n\nI was a fan until mirage, but i felt the game (and studio) drifting a way from their... core roots, ever since they released Syndicate. And it never managed to reach the heights it had before, ever again.\n\nMirage was my last... chance... I was willing to give the franchise, believing ubisoft when they said \"a return to the original roots\". Then they made the same game, as the last 3 releases, and added even worse magic hooey booey. No emotion, no satisfaction, no pleasure. Just a product, meant to sell based on nostalgia. \n\nUbisoft isn't making games for gamers to enjoy. They are making products, made for the masses to be BOUGHT. They look at us as wallets and consumers, not target audiences that will appreciate their \"art\".",

It just felt like more of the same to me tho so I played less than Odyssey unfortunately. Idk why I wrote all this even but I guess AC Origins is my favorite of the last 3. Ghost of Tsushima coming out and being amazing should have stopped Ubi from even attempting the Samurai setting but atp i think they felt the pressure to deliver not only to us gamers but to shareholders. \n I wish games were still just made for the love of gaming and not greed but here we are in 2025",

Origins had interesting things to see out in it's wilderness where that all felt like an afterthought in Odyssey. You might run into a random animal in Odyssey but there wasn't ever anything unique or that interesting where Origins even had entire deserts that served no other purpose than immersion.\n\nOdyssey was a blast for about 30 hours for me, then my interest dropped off hard as the obvious game loop and formula of the map hit me. I put well over 60 hours into Origins and still wanted more.\n\nAnyways, if you haven't played Origins, try it out. The mountain of small details all add up to making it an incredibly immersive experience that's greater than the sum of its parts, imo. Even in just the first 15 minutes of gameplay, it feels soooo much different to Odyssey. A bit slower but in a way that feels good to me. \n\nAlso, I will die on the hill that Origins hand to hand combat is far better than Odyssey's easy parry spam fest.",

The parkour is worse than valhalla...Basim sticks to everything and can't jump on angles...he doesn't get a bow?!?!?!? You move extremely slowly and the mount moves slower near cities for no reason other than to waste player time. They charged full price for something that had far less story than Rogue did. Hell, Miles Morales had more story and effort put into it and they knew to sell that for less!\n\nJust a sub-par game in the franchise and a massive disappointment to most of us.

Instead of one huge map that’s all interconnected, it has multiple smaller open-world, explorable areas and then some more platformer-style “levels” mixed in between.

Sony is known for letting their developers do what they want was my point, which is why they have a lot of dead franchises because those develops have moved on and want to do other things. \n\nAlso, Ubisoft doesn’t have a single studio behind Assassin’s Creed and it’s unlikely Sony would buy the scattered studios they do have, buying the IP rights doesn’t give you access to the studio that made it. Forming a new studio and hiring people that worked on the series would be the best thing to do. For example recently someone bought the rights to make Hi-Fi Rush games from MS then hired developers that had worked on the first game but had been let go by MS. They don’t own the original studio but they’ve effectively recreated them. Lol",

I also think shorter games are often TOO short, and they always leave me wanting way more (Doom Eternal and Dishonored spring to mind).\n\nThe issue is that Ubisoft really struggles to write compelling stories. In particular with Odyssey and Valhalla, their stories are lackluster because there’s loads of filler content within the campaign itself. If Valhalla’s story was only the regions with Sigurd and Basim, and the other regions are optional content, it would be amazing. But by making each region a part of the larger narrative the story is unfocused and monotonous. \n\nOrigins’ story works, because every act of the story is thematically related to parents and their children (like the poisoned waters causing miscarriages, or the Scarab and his son being an inverse reflection of Bayek and his son), or directly related to Bayek’s personal revenge mission. Mirage works because its short and concise and to the point.\n\nI’m all for Ubisoft just crafting a better story, but considering how that’s always my biggest issue with most Ubisoft titles, I think it’s more realistic to see a shorter length instead (which would end up improving the story, going back to my thoughts on Valhalla).",

Literally my second sentence \"The issue isn't so much that you're playing as a black man\". But instead of listening and understanding, you say , \"I don't want to play as a black man or Japanese woman.\"  When the truth is, I just want to play a samurai game as Japanese male. Which you manage to turn into, I'm a racist and misogynist. Because that's level of maturity you're resorting to, seemingly, is that someone has to be a racist in this situation or it invalidates your opinion. If you were mature about it, you wouldn't be so quick to try and label people to fit your world view, but actually listen to others and understand their world view, and understand that people can dislike the game for reasons other than racism.   \n  \nCalling things racist that aren't doesn't do anyone any good. It's like the boy who cried wolf.  You may think your \"fighting the good fight\" but in reality you probably do more harm than good by saying people that don't like the game are racist.

I thought I made it crystal clear that the reason I didn't like the game is because I couldn't play as a male Japanese man in a game that's set in feudal Japan as a samurai. It's about immersion.\n\nYou have literally demonized and judged an entire group of people based on what? Did you do a poll to figure out how many people claim racism? Or did you just see that people didn't wanna play a character that seemed out of place and assume racism? You're doing the same thing to people that you don't like being done to you.\n\nI'm not sure why you can't understand why people don't want to play a game set in fuedal japan that doesn't feature a japanese man. I feel like you're just being obtuse at this point, but maybe not. Would you be ok if they made a AAA game of black panther but made the black panther a white guy because they wrote the story to be that he earned the title? Because that game would bomb.

I didn't watch prince of persia because I don't wanna see a white guy play as a middle eastern person.

That's not some random game some people played, it's considered the best souls series outside of souls games and was runner up for game of the year. I'll take your word for it, but very odd as an actual gamer. Also, you think you're proving a point by being consistent, but all you're doing is denying Japanese history because it doesn't fit your perception of what Japanese history should be lol. Both Yasuke and William Adams are respected parts of Japanese culture; stop projecting your person ideals on to an entire ethnicity and culture. \n\nAlso, you bring up black panther...what's the correlation? What does an actual historical figure being used in a game have in common in any way, shape, or form with a comic book character whose story heavily revolves around being from Africa? Is there any correlation at all besides them both being black Africans? No race swapping is happening so you really just pulled this out of your ass. You'll also continue questioning why you get labeled as racist. \n\n>The kind of rhetoric where people get called racist and misogynist just for a having a different opinion is part of the reason why Trump got elected twice.\n\nTrump was elected twice because he ran on the platform of xenophobia, religious legislation, and blaming minorities for socioeconomic issues white people are affected by. But sure, we can also say it's because some people got called racist on the internet. That's actually (slightly) better than your implication that so many white people are such snowflakes that people calling out racism made them willingly vote for the oppression of others. Honestly a very weird take.",

                "body": "Dude there's a million games out there. Souls are a niche genre that a lot of people, including myself, don't have any desire to play. That's the point you want to attack? Because I've never heard of a game in a genre I don't play? I don't play racing games as well, so attack my lack of racing game knowledge too, while you're at it. You're really just nitpicking at this point and attacking pretty much every little thing I say.\n\n I'm not denying Japanese history. Again, you're making assumptions based off your imagination. I'm not saying the guy didn't exist. And I'll admit, I have almost no knowledge of Japan outside of what I've experienced in games and movies, and I had no prior knowledge of the protagonist. But every other time I've seen Samurai depicted, it was always by a Japanese male. So when fans have been asking for a Japan setting for AC, I'm sure most people had in mind playing a character that looks similar to how samurai have been depicted our entire lives. I still don't understand why that's so hard to wrap your mind around, and that it's gotta be racist to have that desire. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nI bring up black panther to try and help you understand why immersion matters. You don't seem to comprehend why someone would want to play as a male Japanese person in a Samurai game. Both are stories written by people. Just like someone is writing a fictional story about Japan based around historical context, as has all ac games have been, Black Panther is a story written by people, and marvel has race swapped a lot. So if the expectation is that if we ever get a black panther game, and they choose to write in a white character that takes the mantel for whatever reason, then it's going to disappoint a lot of people. If they came out with a white black panther game, and you said its bs, I'm not going to say you're racist because you don't want to play as a white black panther. Would it be better if I mentioned wolverine, and that I wouldn't want to play as an asian wolverine, that I want my wolverine to look as similar to Hugh Jackman as possible? We're talking about stories and games written by people who control the narrative.   \n  \nAgain, it's no different than not liking Nioh because the antagonist is white. That person is based on a real life person, but I have no desire to play that character. And no, that doesn't make me a fucking racist because I don't wanna play as a white Samurai. \n\nI'd play the shit out of an Afro Samurai game, with the main protagonist being black. Because it would fit in that setting, and I could be immersed in the game. \n\nA black samurai, just like a white samurai, just seems out of place. Because while they existed IRL, almost nobody pictures playing as them, because when we think of Samurai, we think of Japanese males.\n\nHad they given us a choice between a Japanese male samurai and a black samurai, I wouldn't have given 2 shits. But to not even have the option to play as what we had imagined doing all these years is disappointing. \n\n\"You'll also continue questioning why you get labeled as racist.\" Yes, because you can't seem to explain what's racist about what I say, you just label something as racist that you don't agree with and move on. Just like you made me out to be a sexist because I didn't mention the japanese woman in the game, or whether or not I wanted to play as her. \n\nYou just throw labels around to just demonize people, but have nothing to back it up other than your preconceived notion that anyone not liking the game is racist. How am I supposed to take you seriously and get educated here when you all you do is hurl insults at me and continue to mislabel me just because you're cool and edgy or whatever fuckin reason?",

The game is called *ASSASSIN'S CREED*. Not samurai's creed. Not male Japanese creed. ***Assassin's Creed***. The game is not about samurai. It's not about Japanese males. The **assassin** is a woman.

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI’ve played a lot of the RPG series and shadows is by far my favourite so far. Really enjoying the style, setting, gameplay, story & stealth.\n\nI’ve got a struggle with my muscle memory making me press X on Xbox controller to dodge, and swapped crouch and dodge in the controls, however it now conflicts with the ‘character ability’, and some abilities don’t work.\n\nWhen walking in the animus loading screen, leap strike and escape strike work fine, however in real world tests, the ability is broken and doesn’t work. Is there a tried & tested swap of the crouch / dodge ability to allow the key binds on xbox to use this without breaking abilities?\n\nThe only change I’ve done is B to crouch, and X to dodge, and hold B to prone.\n\nIn about 30 hours in with this and didn’t notice how much it’s effected anything else, but seems weird it works in the animus loading screen but not actually in game.\n",

Tge only exception ive found is quick throw, i have crouch mapped to R1 and the characters crouches during observation instead of throwing.",
